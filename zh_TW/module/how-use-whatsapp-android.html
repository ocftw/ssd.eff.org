<meta name="description" content="We don&#039;t currently recommend WhatsApp for secure communications. See here for a full explanation. In particular, we&#039;re concerned about WhatsApp&#039;s August 2016 announcement of a new privacy policy that allows data sharing with parent company Facebook. This allows Facebook access to several pieces of WhatsApp users&#039; information, including WhatsApp phone numbers and usage data. Existing WhatsApp users at the time of the privacy policy switch had a grace period to change their settings and prevent Facebook from suggesting friends or serving ads based on WhatsApp data. New accounts, however, do not have the option to refuse these expanded uses of their data. Instead, the only option available to new users is whether to join WhatsApp at all under the new privacy policy and all of the data sharing it entails. Even though the company assures users it will not share their data directly with advertisers, this nevertheless presents a clear threat to users’ control of how their WhatsApp data is shared and used. In addition we&#039;re concerned with WhatsApp&#039;s web app. WhatsApp provides an HTTPS-secured web interface for users to send and receive messages. However, as with all websites, the resources needed to load the application are delivered each and every time you visit that site. So, even if there is support for crypto in the browser, the web application can easily be modified to serve a malicious version of the application upon any given pageload, which is capable of delivering all your messages to a third party. WhatsApp does still provide end-to-end encryption, which ensures that a message is turned into a secret message by its original sender, and decoded only by its final recipient. We take no issue with the way this encryption is performed. In fact, we hope that the encryption protocol WhatsApp uses, the Signal Protocol, becomes more widespread in the future. Instead, we are concerned about WhatsApp’s security despite the best efforts of the Signal Protocol. If you would still like to use WhatsApp, see our tutorial below and be sure to turn off cloud backups and turn on fingerprint change notifications (see section on Additional Security Settings)." />

<p>我們特別擔心 WhatsApp 在 2016 年 8 月所發布的一項新隱私政策：分享資料給母公司 Facebook。這讓 Facebook 可以存取 WhatsApp 使用者許多資訊，包括 WhatsApp 的電話號碼和使用資料。</p>
<p>在隱私政策切換期間，現有的 WhatsApp 使用者有一段寬限期可以改變設定，防止 Facebook 建議朋友或基於 WhatsApp 資料提供廣告。但是，新帳戶無法拒絕這些資料的擴展使用。新使用者只能決定要不要加入 WhatsApp，接受 WhatsApp 的新隱私政策和資料共用。雖然 WhatsApp 向使用者保證不會直接將資料提供給廣告商，但該政策已對 WhatsApp 使用者如何分享和使用資料的控制權，明顯構成了<a class="glossify-link" data-original-title="In computer&lt;br /&gt;&#10;        security, a threat is a potential event that could undermine&lt;br /&gt;&#10;        your efforts to defend your data.

<p>另外，我們也很擔心 WhatsApp 的網頁應用程式。雖然 WhatsApp 為使用者提供 <a href="../glossary/https.html">HTTPS</a> 加密的<a href="https://web.whatsapp.com/" rel="noreferrer">網頁界面</a>來發送和接收訊息，但是跟所有網站一樣，每次訪問該網站時都必須載入瀏覽所需的資源。如此一來，即使<a href="https://www.chromium.org/blink/webcrypto" rel="noreferrer">瀏覽器支援加密</a>，<a href="https://www.chromium.org/blink/webcrypto" rel="noreferrer">網頁應用程式也可被輕易修改，以在載入特定頁面時夾帶惡意程式</a>，而將您的所有訊息傳送給第三方。</p>

The fingerprints presented by cryptographic software usually consist of around 40 letters and numbers. If you carefully check that a fingerprint has the right value, you should be safe against impersonation using a fake key.

<h3>步驟 1：下載並安裝 WhatsApp</h3>
<p>在您的 Android 裝置上進入 Google Play 商店並搜尋「WhatsApp」。選擇 <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.whatsapp" rel="noreferrer">WhatsApp Inc 的 WhatsApp</a> 應用程式。</p>
<p>點擊「安裝」 (Install) 後，您會看到一些 WhatsApp 需要存取才能正常運作的 Android 功能。點擊「接受」(Accept)。</p>
<p>WhatsApp 下載完成後，點擊「打開」(Open) 啟動應用程式。</p>
<h3>步驟 2：註冊並驗證您的電話號碼</h3>
<p>首先，您必須接受 WhatsApp 的服務條款和隱私政策。</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2016/04/26/tos.png" height="634" width="357" /></p>
<p class="warning">WhatsApp 將請求存取您的手機聯絡人。如果您授予此存取權限，WhatsApp 將會取得您完整的手機通訊錄。如果您不授予此存取權限，您仍可以手動新增聯絡人以傳送訊息，但是您將無法打電話給對方。如果您想發送照片、影音或檔案，Whatsapp 也會請求存取這些檔案。</p>
<p>如果你想授予這些權限，請點擊「繼續」(Continue)，然後點擊「允許」(Allow)。</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2016/04/26/permissions.png" height="634" width="356" /></p>
<p>您將看到的畫面如下：</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2016/04/26/enter-phone.png" height="634" width="356" /></p>
<p>輸入您的手機號碼，然後點擊指向右的箭頭。您將看到一個驗證對話方塊：</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2016/04/26/phone-verify.png" height="634" width="356" /></p>
<p>點擊「確定」(OK)。為了驗證您的電話號碼，系統會發送一個六位數代碼的簡訊給您。此時，您可能會看到一個對話方塊，表示 WhatsApp 正在請求存取您的 SMS 訊息。如果您點擊「允許」(Allow)，WhatsApp 將在您收到代碼並完成註冊後自動識別。如果點擊「拒絕」(Deny)，您將必須手動檢查您的簡訊應用程式來取得代碼，並將其輸入到如下所示的對話方塊中：</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2016/04/26/phone-code.png" height="634" width="356" /></p>
<p>在接下來的幾個畫面，系統可能會詢問您是否要將訊息備份到 Google 雲端硬碟。為了確保未加密的備份不會發送給 Google，請選擇「從不」(Never)，然後點擊「完成」(Done)。</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2016/04/26/google-drive-setup.png" height="634" width="356" /></p>

<p>請您的聯絡人在他們的手機上也進行一樣的過程。接下來的畫面標題為「驗證安全碼」(Verify security code)。</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2016/04/26/verify-code.png" height="634" width="356" /></p>
<p>您會看到一串 60 個數字。您可以人工讀出這些數字，確認它們是否與您的聯絡人號碼一致，或讓聯絡人掃描出現在此畫面的 QR 碼以進行驗證。</p>
<p class="tip">另一種您可能會考慮使用的驗證方法，是將數字擷圖並使用第二個安全管道 (如 <a href="../glossary/pgp.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="PGP" title="PGP 或優良保密協定是最早流行的公開金鑰密碼學之一。其創建者菲爾‧齊默爾曼 (Phil Zimmermann) 在 1991 年撰寫了這個程式，以幫助社運人士和其他人保護他們的通訊。當這個程式散布到美國以外時，他被美國政府正式調查。當時，出口強力的公開金鑰加密等工具是違反美國法律的。PGP 以商業軟體產品的形式繼續存在著。也可以免費使用與 PGP 基礎標準相同的 GnuPG (或 GPG)。由於兩者使用同一種可互換的方式，所以有人即使是用 GnuPG，也會說用「PGP 金鑰」或發送「PGP 訊息」。" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" data-html="true" data-toggle="popover" data-container="body" data-content="PGP or Pretty Good Privacy was one of the first popular implementations of public key cryptography.

PGP continues to exist as a commercial software product. A free implementation of the same underlying standard that PGP uses called GnuPG (or GPG) is also available. Because both use the same interchangeable approach, people will refer to using a “PGP key” or sending a “PGP message”, even if they are using GnuPG.

<p>完成這個步驟後，您就可以放心，與這個聯絡人的加密通訊確實只能由您和您的聯絡人存取。這個方法同時適用於 WhatsApp 中的文字訊息以及語音通話。</p>
