But, do not fear! Security is a process, and through thoughtful planning, you can assess what’s right for you. Security isn’t about the tools you use or the software you download. It begins with understanding the unique threats you face and how you can counter those threats.</p>
<p>In computer security, a <a href="../glossary/threat.html" class="glossify-link" title="In computer security, a threat is a potential event that could undermine your efforts to defend your data. Threats can be intentional (conceived by attackers), or they could be accidental (you might leave your computer turned on and unguarded). ">threat<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a> is a potential event that could undermine your efforts to defend your data. You can counter the threats you face by determining what you need to protect and from whom you need to protect it. This process is called “threat modeling.”</p>
<p>This guide will teach you how to <a href="../glossary/threat-model.html" class="glossify-link" title="A way of narrowly thinking about the sorts of protection you want for your data. It's impossible to protect against every kind of trick or attacker, so you should concentrate on which people might want your data, what they might want from it, and how they might get it. Coming up with a set of possible attacks you plan to protect against is called threat modeling. Once you have a threat model, you can conduct a risk analysis. ">threat model<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a>, or how to assess your risks for your digital information and how to determine what solutions are best for you.</p>
<p>What might threat modeling look like? Let’s say you want to keep your house and possessions safe, here are a few questions you might ask:</p>
<p><strong><em>What do I have inside my home that is worth protecting?</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>Assets could include: jewelry, electronics, financial documents, passports, or photos</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>Who do I want to protect it from?</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>Adversaries could include: burglars, roommates, or guests</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>How likely is it that I will need to protect it?</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>Does my neighborhood have a history of burglaries? How trustworthy are my roommates/guests? What are the capabilities of my adversaries? What are the risks I should consider?</li>
</ul><p><em><strong>How bad are the consequences if I fail?</strong></em></p>
<ul><li>Do I have anything in my house that I cannot replace? Do I have the time or money to replace these things? Do I have insurance that covers goods stolen from my home?</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>How much trouble am I willing to go through to prevent these consequences?</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>Am I willing to buy a safe for sensitive documents? Can I afford to buy a high-quality lock? Do I have time to open a security box at my local bank and keep my valuables there?</li>
</ul><p>Once you have asked yourself these questions, you are in a position to assess what measures to take. If your possessions are valuable, but the risk of a break-in is low, then you may not want to invest too much money in a lock. But, if the risk is high, you’ll want to get the best lock on the market, and consider adding a security system.</p>
<p>Building a threat model helps you to understand the unique threats you face, your assets, your <a href="../glossary/adversary.html" class="glossify-link" title="Your adversary is the person or organization attempting to undermine your security goals. Adversaries can be different, depending on the situation. For instance, you may worry about criminals spying on the network at a cafe, or your classmates at a school. Often the adversary is hypothetical.

<p>Threat modeling helps you identify threats to the things you value and determine from whom you need to protect them. When building a <a href="../glossary/threat-model.html" class="glossify-link" title="A way of narrowly thinking about the sorts of protection you want for your data. It's impossible to protect against every kind of trick or attacker, so you should concentrate on which people might want your data, what they might want from it, and how they might get it. Coming up with a set of possible attacks you plan to protect against is called threat modeling. Once you have a threat model, you can conduct a risk analysis. ">threat model<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a>, answer these five questions:</p>
<ol><li>What do I want to protect?</li>
<li>Who do I want to protect it from?</li>
<li>How bad are the consequences if I fail?</li>
<li>How likely is it that I will need to protect it?</li>
<li>How much trouble am I willing to go through to try to prevent potential consequences?</li>
</ol><p>Let’s take a closer look at each of these questions.</p>
<h3>What do I want to protect?</h3>
<p>An “<a href="../glossary/asset.html" class="glossify-link" title="In threat modeling, any piece of data or a device that needs to be protected. ">asset<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a>” is something you value and want to protect. In the context of digital security, an asset is usually some kind of information. For example, your emails, contact lists, instant messages, location, and files are all possible assets. Your devices may also be assets.</p>
<p><em>Make a list of your assets: data that you keep, where it’s kept, who has access to it, and what stops others from accessing it.</em></p>
<h3>Who do I want to protect it from?</h3>
<p>To answer this question, it’s important to identify who might want to target you or your information. A person or entity that poses a threat to your assets is an “<a href="../glossary/adversary.html" class="glossify-link" title="Your adversary is the person or organization attempting to undermine your security goals. Adversaries can be different, depending on the situation. For instance, you may worry about criminals spying on the network at a cafe, or your classmates at a school. Often the adversary is hypothetical. ">adversary<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a>.” Examples of potential adversaries are your boss, your former partner, your business competition, your government, or a hacker on a public network.</p>
<p><em>Make a list of your adversaries, or those who might want to get ahold of your assets. Your list may include individuals, a government agency, or corporations.</em></p>
<p class="warning">Depending on who your adversaries are, under some circumstances this list might be something you want to destroy after you’re done threat modeling.</p>
<h3>How bad are the consequences if I fail?</h3>
<p>There are many ways that an adversary can threaten your data. For example, an adversary can read your private communications as they pass through the network, or they can delete or corrupt your data.</p>
<p>The motives of adversaries differ widely, as do their attacks. A government trying to prevent the spread of a video showing police violence may be content to simply delete or reduce the availability of that video. In contrast, a political opponent may wish to gain access to secret content and publish that content without you knowing.</p>
<p>Threat modeling involves understanding how bad the consequences could be if an adversary successfully attacks one of your assets. To determine this, you should consider the <a href="../glossary/capability.html" class="glossify-link" title="The capability of an attacker (in the sense we use it in this guide) is what it is able to do to achieve its aims. For example, a country's security services might have the capability to listen to telephone calls while a neighbor may have the capability to watch you from their window. To say that an attacker “has&quot; a capability does not mean that they will necessarily use that capability. It does mean that you should consider and prepare for the possibility. ">capability<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a> of your adversary. For example, your mobile phone provider has access to all your phone records and thus has the capability to use that data against you. A hacker on an open Wi-Fi network can access your unencrypted communications. Your government might have stronger capabilities.</p>
<p><em>Write down what your adversary might want to do with your private data.</em></p>
<h3>How likely is it that I will need to protect it?</h3>
<p>Risk is the likelihood that a particular threat against a particular asset will actually occur. It goes hand-in-hand with capability. While your mobile phone provider has the capability to access all of your data, the risk of them posting your private data online to harm your reputation is low.</p>
<p>It is important to distinguish between threats and risks. While a threat is a bad thing that can happen, risk is the likelihood that the threat will occur. For instance, there is a threat that your building might collapse, but the risk of this happening is far greater in San Francisco (where earthquakes are common) than in Stockholm (where they are not).</p>
<p>Conducting a <a href="../glossary/risk-analysis.html" class="glossify-link" title="In computer security, risk analysis is calculating the chance that threats might succeed, so you know how much effort to spend defending against them. There may be many different ways that you might lose control or access to your data, but some of them are less likely than others. Assessing risk means deciding which threats you are going to take seriously, and which may be too rare or too harmless (or too difficult to combat) to worry about. See threat modeling. ">risk analysis<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a> is both a personal and a subjective process; not everyone has the same priorities or views threats in the same way. Many people find certain threats unacceptable no matter what the risk, because the mere presence of the threat at any likelihood is not worth the cost. In other cases, people disregard high risks because they don't view the threat as a problem.</p>
<p><em>Write down which threats you are going to take seriously, and which may be too rare or too harmless (or too difficult to combat) to worry about.</em></p>
<h3>How much trouble am I willing to go through to try to prevent potential consequences?</h3>
<p>Answering this question requires conducting the risk analysis. Not everyone has the same priorities or views threats in the same way.</p>
<p>For example, an attorney representing a client in a national security case would probably be willing to go to greater lengths to protect communications about that case, such as using encrypted email, than a mother who regularly emails her daughter funny cat videos.</p>
<p><em>Write down what options you have available to you to help mitigate your unique threats. Note if you have any financial constraints, technical constraints, or social constraints.</em></p>

<p>But given the large number of companies and websites offering secure programs or hardware, how do you choose the one that's right for you?</p>
</div><div class="field-item odd"><a name="1"></a> <h2><a id="Security" name="Security"></a>Security is a Process, not a Purchase <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#1">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>The first thing to remember before changing the software you use or buying new tools is that no tool is going to give you absolute protection from surveillance in all circumstances. Using <a href="../glossary/encryption.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="encryption" title="A process that takes a message and makes it unreadable except to a person who knows how to &quot;decrypt&quot; it back into a readable form. " data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" data-html="true" data-toggle="popover" data-container="body" data-content="A process that takes a message and makes it unreadable except to a person who knows how to &quot;decrypt&quot; it back into a readable form. ">encryption<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/themes/ssd/img/info.png" /></a> software will generally make it harder for others to read your communications or go through your computer's files. But attacks on your digital security will always seek out the weakest element of your security practices. When you use a new secure tool, you should think about how using it might affect other ways someone could target you. For example, if you decide to use a secure texting program to talk to a contact because you know that your phone might be compromised, might the fact that you're using this program at all give an <a href="../glossary/adversary.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="adversary" title="Your adversary is the person or organization attempting to undermine your security goals. Adversaries can be different, depending on the situation. For instance, you may worry about criminals spying on the network at a cafe, or your classmates at a school. Often the adversary is hypothetical.

Often the adversary is hypothetical. ">adversary<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/themes/ssd/img/info.png" /></a> a clue that you are talking about private information?</p>
<p>Secondly, remember your <a href="../glossary/threat-model.html">threat model</a>. You don't need to buy some expensive encrypted phone system that claims to be “NSA-proof” if your biggest <a href="../glossary/threat.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="threat" title="In computer security, a threat is a potential event that could undermine your efforts to defend your data. Threats can be intentional (conceived by attackers), or they could be accidental (you might leave your computer turned on and unguarded). " data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" data-html="true" data-toggle="popover" data-container="body" data-content="In computer security, a threat is a potential event that could undermine your efforts to defend your data. Threats can be intentional (conceived by attackers), or they could be accidental (you might leave your computer turned on and unguarded). ">threat<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/themes/ssd/img/info.png" /></a> is physical surveillance from a private investigator with no access to internet surveillance tools. Alternatively, if you are facing a government that regularly jails dissidents <em>because</em> they use encryption tools, it may make sense to use simpler tricks—like a set of pre-arranged codes—rather than risk leaving evidence that you use encryption software on your laptop.</p>
<p>Given all that, here are some questions you can ask about a tool before downloading, purchasing, or using it.</p>
</div><div class="field-item even"><a name="2"></a> <h2><a id="Transparent" name="Transparent"></a>How Transparent is it? <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#2">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>Even though digital security seems to be mostly about keeping secrets, there's a strong belief among security researchers that openness and transparency leads to more secure tools.</p>
<p>Much of the software used and recommended by the digital security community is open source, which is to say that the code that defines how it works is publicly available for others to examine, modify, and share. By being transparent about how their program works, the creators of these tools invite others to look for security flaws, and help improve the program.</p>
<p>Open software provides the opportunity for better security but does not guarantee it. The open source advantage relies in part on a community of technologists actually checking the code, which for small projects (and even for popular, complex ones) may be hard to achieve. When you're considering using a tool, see if its source code is available, and whether the code has an independent security audit to confirm the quality of its security. At the very least, software or hardware should have a detailed technical explanation of how it functions, for other experts to inspect.</p>
</div><div class="field-item odd"><a name="3"></a> <h2><a id="Clarity" name="Clarity"></a>How Clear are its Creators About its Advantages and Disadvantages? <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#3">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>No software or hardware is entirely secure. Creators or sellers who are honest about the limitations of their product will give you a much stronger idea of whether their application is appropriate for you.</p>
<p class="warning">Don't trust blanket statements that say that the code is “military-grade” or “NSA-proof”; these mean nothing and give a strong warning that the creators are overconfident or unwilling to consider the possible failings in their product.</p>
<p>Because attackers are always trying to discover new ways to break the security of tools, software and hardware often needs to be updated to fix new vulnerabilities. It can be a serious problem if the creators of a tool are unwilling to do this, either because they fear bad publicity, or because they have not built the infrastructure to fix problems.</p>
<p>You can't predict the future, but a good indicator of how toolmakers will behave in the future is their past activity. If the tool's website lists previous issues and links to regular updates and information—like specifically how long it has been since the software was last updated—you can be more confident that they will continue to provide this service in the future.</p>
</div><div class="field-item even"><a name="4"></a> <h2><a id="Compromised" name="Compromised"></a>What Happens if the Creators are Compromised? <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#4">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>When security toolmakers build software and hardware, they (just like you) must have a clear <a href="../glossary/threat-model.html">threat model</a>. The best creators will explicitly describe what kind of attackers they can protect you from in their documentation.</p>
<p>But there's one attacker that many manufacturers do not want to think about: what if they, themselves, are compromised or decide to <a href="../glossary/attack.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="attack" title="In computer security, an attack is a method that can be used to compromise security, or its actual use. An attacker is the person or organization using an attack. An attack method is sometimes called an &quot;exploit.&quot; " data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" data-html="true" data-toggle="popover" data-container="body" data-content="In computer security, an attack is a method that can be used to compromise security, or its actual use. An attacker is the person or organization using an attack. An attack method is sometimes called an &quot;exploit.&quot; ">attack<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/themes/ssd/img/info.png" /></a> their own users. For instance, a court or government may compel a company to give up personal data or create a “backdoor” that will remove all the protections their tool offers. You may want to consider the jurisdiction(s) where the creators are based. If your <a href="../glossary/threat.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="threat" title="In computer security, a threat is a potential event that could undermine your efforts to defend your data. Threats can be intentional (conceived by attackers), or they could be accidental (you might leave your computer turned on and unguarded).

Threats can be intentional (conceived by attackers), or they could be accidental (you might leave your computer turned on and unguarded). ">threat<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/themes/ssd/img/info.png" /></a> is from the government of Iran, for example, a US-based company will be able to resist Iranian court orders, even if it must comply with US orders.</p>
<p>Even if a creator is able to resist government pressure, an attacker may attempt to achieve the same result by breaking into the toolmakers' own systems in order to attack its customers.</p>
<p>The most resilient tools are those that consider this as a possible attack, and are designed to defend against this. Look for language that asserts that a creator cannot access private data, rather than promises that a creator <em>will</em> not. Look for institutions with a <a href="https://www.eff.org/who-has-your-back-government-data-requests-2014" target="_blank">reputation for fighting court orders for personal data</a>.</p>
</div><div class="field-item odd"><a name="5"></a> <h2><a id="Recalls" name="Recalls"></a>Check for Recalls and Online Criticism <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#5">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>Of course, companies selling products and enthusiasts advertising their latest software can be misled, be misleading, or even outright lie. A product that was originally secure might be discovered to have terrible flaws in the future. Make sure you stay well-informed on the latest news about the tools that you use.</p>
</div><div class="field-item even"><a name="6"></a> <h2><a id="Sametool" name="Sametool"></a>Do you Know Others who Use the Same Tool? <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#6">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>It's a lot of work for one person to keep up with the latest news about a tool. If you have colleagues who use a particular product or service, work with them to stay informed about what's happening.</p>
</div><div class="field-item odd"><a name="7"></a> <h2><a id="Products" name="Products"></a>Products Mentioned in This Guide <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#7">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>We try to ensure that the software and hardware we mention in this guide complies with the criteria we've listed above: we have made a good faith effort to only list products that have a solid grounding in what we currently know about digital security, are generally transparent about their operation (and their failings), have defenses against the possibility that the creators themselves will be compromised, and are currently maintained, with a large and technically-knowledgeable user base. We believe that they have, at the time of writing, the eye of a wide audience who is examining them for flaws, and would raise concerns to the public quickly. Please understand that we do not have the resources to examine or make independent assurances about their security, we are not endorsing these products and cannot guarantee complete security.</p>
</div><div class="field-item even"><a name="8"></a> <h2><a id="Which_device" name="Which_device"></a>Which Phone Should I Buy? Which Computer? <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#8">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>One of the most frequent questions asked of security trainers is “Should I buy Android or an iPhone?” or “Should I use a PC or a Mac?” or “What <a href="../glossary/operating-system.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="operating system" title="A program that runs all the other programs on a computer. Windows, Android and Apple's OS X and iOS are all examples of operating systems. " data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" data-html="true" data-toggle="popover" data-container="body" data-content="A program that runs all the other programs on a computer. Windows, Android and Apple's OS X and iOS are all examples of operating systems. ">operating system<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/themes/ssd/img/info.png" /></a> should I use?” There are no simple answers to these questions. The relative safety of software and devices is constantly shifting as new flaws are discovered and old bugs are fixed. Companies may compete with each other to provide you with better security, or they may all be under pressure from governments to weaken that security.</p>
<p>Some general advice is almost always true, however. When you buy a device or an operating system, keep current with its software updates. Updates will often fix security problems in older code that attacks can exploit. Older phones and operating systems are no longer supported, even for security updates. In particular, Microsoft has made it clear that Windows XP and earlier Windows versions will not receive fixes for even severe security problems. If you use XP, you cannot expect it to be secure from attackers. (The same is true for OS X before 10.7.5 or "Lion").</p>

If used correctly, it can protect the contents of your messages, text, and even files from being understood even by well-funded government surveillance programs. When Edward Snowden says “<a href="../glossary/encryption.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="encryption" title="A process that takes a message and makes it unreadable except to a person who knows how to &quot;decrypt&quot; it back into a readable form.

It should be noted that it's not unheard of for governments to steal private keys off of particular people's computers (by taking the computers away, or by putting <a href="../glossary/malware.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="malware" title="Malware is short for malicious software: programs that are designed to conduct unwanted actions on your device.

<p>Unfortunately, PGP is also pretty bad at being easy to understand, or use. The strong encryption that PGP uses—<a href="../glossary/public-key-encryption.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="public key encryption" title="Traditional encryption systems use the same secret, or key, to encrypt and decrypt a message.

Public key encryption uses two keys: one to encrypt, and another to decrypt. This has all kinds of useful consequences. For one, it means that you can hand out the key to encrypt messages to you, and as long as you keep the other key secret, anyone with that key can talk to you securely.

">public key encryption<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/themes/ssd/img/info.png" /></a>—is ingenious, but hard to wrap your head around. PGP software itself has been around since 1991, which makes it the same vintage as the early versions of Microsoft Windows, and its appearance hasn't changed much since then.</p>
<p>The good news is that there are many programs available now which can hide the ancient design of PGP and make it somewhat easier to use, especially when it comes to encrypting and authenticating email—the main use of PGP. We've included guides to installing and operating this software elsewhere.</p>
<p>Before you play around with PGP or other programs that use it, though, it's worth spending a few minutes understanding the basics of public key encryption: what it can do for you, what it can't do, and when you should use it.</p>

Encryption is one of several technologies that make up the field called cryptography. ">encrypt<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/themes/ssd/img/info.png" /></a> that into a coded message that is incomprehensible to anyone looking at it (“OhsieW5ge+osh1aehah6,” say). We send that encrypted message over the Internet, where it can be read by lots of people, but hopefully not understood by any of them. Then, when it arrives at its destination, our intended recipient, and only our intended recipient, has some way of decrypting it back into the original message.</p>
<p>How does our recipient know how to decode the message, when nobody else can? It must be because they know some extra information that nobody else knows. Let's call this the decoding <a href="../glossary/key.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="key" title="In cryptography, a piece of data which gives you the capability to encrypt or decrypt a message. " data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" data-html="true" data-toggle="popover" data-container="body" data-content="In cryptography, a piece of data which gives you the capability to encrypt or decrypt a message. ">key<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/themes/ssd/img/info.png" /></a>, because it <em>unlocks</em> the message inside the code.</p>
<p>How does the recipient know this key? Mostly, it's because the sender has previously told them the key, whether it's “try holding the message up in a mirror” or “take each letter and convert it to the next letter in the alphabet.” There's a problem with this strategy though. If you're worried about being spied upon when you send your coded message, how do you send the recipient the key without someone spying on <em>that</em> conversation too? There's no point sending an ingeniously encrypted message if your attacker already knows the key to decoding it. And if you have a secret way to send decoding keys, why don't you just use that for all your secret messages?</p>
<p>Public-key <a href="../glossary/cryptography.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="cryptography" title="The art of designing secret codes or ciphers that let you send and receive messages to a recipient without others being able to understand the message.

">cryptography<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/themes/ssd/img/info.png" /></a> has a neat solution for this. Each person in a conversation has a way of creating two keys. One is their private key, which they keep to themselves and never let anyone else know. The other is a public key, which they hand out to anyone who wants to communicate with them. It doesn't matter who can see the public key. You can put it online where everyone can see it.</p>
<p>The “keys” themselves are, at heart, actually very large numbers, with certain mathematical properties. The public key and private key are connected. If you encode something using the public key, then someone else can decode it with its matching private key.</p>
<p>Let's see how that might work. You want to send a secret message to Aarav. Aarav has a private key, but like a good <a href="../glossary/public-key-encryption.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="public key encryption" title="Traditional encryption systems use the same secret, or key, to encrypt and decrypt a message.

">cryptography<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/themes/ssd/img/info.png" /></a> gets rid of the problem of smuggling the decoding key to the person you want to send a message to, because that person already <em>has</em> the key. You just need to get hold of the matching public, encoding key, which the recipient can hand out to everyone, including spies. Because it's only useful for encoding a message, it is useless for anyone trying to decode the message.</p>
<p>But there's more! If you encode a message with a certain public key, it can only be decoded by the matching private key. But the opposite is also true. If you encode a message with a certain private key, it can only be decoded by its matching public key.</p>
<p>Why would this be useful? At first glance, there doesn't seem to be any advantage to making a secret message with your private key that everyone in the world (or at least, everyone who has your public key) can crack. But suppose I wrote a message that said “I promise to pay Aazul $100,” and then turned it into a secret message using my private key. Anyone could decode that message—but only one person could have written it: the person who has my private key. If I've done a good job keeping my private key safe, that means me, and only me. In effect, by encoding it with my private key, I've made sure that it could only have come from me. In other words, I've done the same thing with this digital message as we do when we <em>sign</em> a message in the real world.</p>
<p>Signing also makes messages tamper-proof. If someone tried to change that “I promise to pay Aazul $100” into “I promise to pay Bob $100,” they would not be able to re-sign it using my private key. So a signed message is guaranteed to originate from a certain source, and not be messed with in transit.</p>

<p>It should be clear by now that public key cryptography becomes more useful, the more people know your public key. It should also be apparent that you need to keep your private key very safe.

<p>PGP is all about making sure the contents of a message are secret, genuine, and untampered with. But that's not the only privacy concern you might have. As we've noted, information <em>about</em> your messages can be as revealing as their contents (See “metadata”). If you're exchanging PGP messages with a known dissident in your country, you may be in danger for simply communicating with them, even without those messages being decoded. Indeed, in some countries you can face imprisonment simply for refusing to decode encrypted messages.</p>
<p class="warning">PGP does nothing to disguise who you are talking to, or that you are using PGP to do so. Indeed, if you upload your public <a href="../glossary/key.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="key" title="In cryptography, a piece of data which gives you the capability to encrypt or decrypt a message.

<p>You don't have to do that. You can keep your PGP public key quiet, and only give it to people you feel safe with, and tell them not to upload it to the public keyservers. You don't need to attach your name to a key.</p>
<p>Disguising that you are communicating with a particular person is more difficult. One way to do this is for both of you to use anonymous email accounts, and access them using <a href="../module/how-use-tor-windows.html#overlay=en/node/57/" target="_blank">Tor</a>. If you do this, PGP will still be useful, both for keeping your email messages private from others, and proving to each other that the messages have not been tampered with.</p>

<p>Once you have signed in to one or more of your accounts, you can start using OTR.</p>
<p class="tip">Remember: In order to have a conversation using OTR, both people need to be using a chat program that supports OTR.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Initiate an OTR Chat</h3>
<p>First, identify someone who is using OTR, and initiate a conversation with them in Adium by double-clicking on their name. Once you have opened the chat window, you will see a small, open lock in the upper left-hand corner of the chat window. Click on the lock and select “Initiate Encrypted OTR Chat.”</p>
<h3>Step 2: Verify Your Connection</h3>
<p>Once you have initiated the chat and the other person has accepted the invitation, you will see the lock icon close; this is how you know that your chat is now encrypted (congratulations!) – But wait, there’s still another step!</p>
<p>At this time, you have initiated an unverified, encrypted chat. This means that while your communications are encrypted, you have not yet determined and verified the identity of the person you are chatting with. Unless you are in the same room and can see each other’s screens, it is important that you verify each other’s identities. For more information, read the module on <a href="../module/key-verification.html#overlay=en/node/37/" target="_blank">Key Verification</a>.</p>
<p>To verify another user’s identity using Adium, click again on the lock, and select “Verify.” You will be shown a window that displays both your <a href="../glossary/key.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="key" title="In cryptography, a piece of data which gives you the capability to encrypt or decrypt a message.

The fingerprints presented by cryptographic software usually consist of around 40 letters and numbers. If you carefully check that a fingerprint has the right value, you should be safe against impersonation using a fake key.

This means that, using some method, you and the person with whom you’re chatting will need to check to make sure that the keys that you are being shown by Adium match precisely.</p>
<p>The easiest way to do this is to read them aloud to one another in person, but that’s not always possible. There are different ways to accomplish this with varying degrees of trustworthiness. For example, you can read your keys aloud to one another on the phone if you recognize each other’s voices or send them using another verified method of communication such as <a href="../glossary/pgp.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="PGP" title="PGP or Pretty Good Privacy was one of the first popular implementations of public key cryptography.

<p class="warning">The most important thing is that you verify that every single letter and digit matches perfectly.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Disable Logging</h3>
<p>Now that you have initiated an encrypted chat and verified your chat partner’s identity, there’s one more thing you need to do. Unfortunately, Adium logs your OTR-encrypted chats by default, saving them to your hard drive. This means that, despite the fact that they’re encrypted, they are being saved in plain text on your hard drive.</p>
<p>To <a href="https://trac.adium.im/wiki/MessageHistory" rel="noreferrer">disable logging</a>, click “Adium” in the menu at the top of your screen, then “Preferences.” In the new window, select “General” and then disable “Log messages” and “Log OTR-secured chats.” Remember, though, that you do not have control over the person with whom you are chatting—she could be logging or taking screenshots of your conversation, even if you yourself have disabled logging.</p>
<p>Your settings should now look like this:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/field/image/adium_3.png" /></p>
<p wrap="">Also, when Adium displays notifications of new messages, the contents of those messages may be logged by the OS X Notification Center. This means that while Adium leaves no trace of your communications on your own computer or your correspondent's, either your or their computer's version of OS X may preserve a record. To prevent this, you may want to disable notifications.</p>
<p wrap="">To do this, select "Events" in the Preferences window, and look for any entries that say "Display a notification." For each entry, expand it by clicking the gray triangle, and then click the newly-exposed line that say "Display a notification," then click the minus icon ("-") at the lower left to remove that line." If you are worried about records left on your computer, you should also turn on full-disk <a href="../glossary/encryption.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="encryption" title="A process that takes a message and makes it unreadable except to a person who knows how to &quot;decrypt&quot; it back into a readable form.

While there are several ways to use OTR on Microsoft Windows, we have found the most consistent and easy-to-use tool to be the Pidgin chat client with the pidgin-otr plugin.</p>
<p class="warning">The instant messaging client for Windows PC, Pidgin, automatically logs conversations by default, however you do have the ability to disable this feature. That said, you do not have control over the person with whom you are chatting—she could be logging or taking screenshots of your conversation, even if you yourself have disabled logging.</p>

<p>When you have a chat conversation using Google Hangouts or Facebook chat on the Google or Facebook websites, that chat <em>is</em> encrypted using <em><a href="../glossary/https.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="HTTPS" title="If you've ever seen a web address spelled out as “http://www.example.com/”, you'll recognize the “http” bit of this term.

HTTPS (the S stands for “secure”) uses encryption to better protect the data you send to websites, and the information they return to you, from prying eyes.

">HTTPS<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/themes/ssd/img/info.png" /></a></em>, which means the content of your chat is protected from hackers and other third parties while it’s in transit. It is <em>not</em>, however, protected from Google or Facebook, which have the keys to your conversations and can hand them over to authorities or use them for marketing purposes.</p>
<p>After you have installed Pidgin, you can sign in to it using multiple accounts at the same time. For example, you could use Google Hangouts, Facebook, and <a href="../glossary/xmpp.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="XMPP" title="A open standard for instant messages - Google uses XMPP for Google Talk; Facebook used to offer it, but stopped.

<p>A window will open up. You are asked: “How would you like to authenticate your buddy?”</p>
<p>The drop-down has three options:</p>
</div><div class="field-item even"><a name="12"></a> <h2>Shared Secret <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#12">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>A shared secret is a line of text you and the person you want to chat have agreed to use ahead of time. You should have shared this in person and never have exchanged it over insecure channels such as email or Skype.</p>
<p>You and your buddy need to enter this text together. Click the “Authenticate” button.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/field/image/how_to_use_otr_-_39.png" /></p>
<p>The shared secret verification is useful if you and your buddy have already made arrangements to chat in the future but haven't yet created OTR fingerprints on the computer you are using. This only works if both of you are using Pidgin.</p>

<p>Manual fingerprint verification is useful if you were already given your buddy's fingerprint and are now connecting with Pidgin. This will not be useful if your buddy changed computers or had to create new fingerprints.</p>
<p>If the fingerprint you were given and the fingerprint on the screen match, select “I have” and click the “Authenticate” button.</p>

</div><div class="field-item even"><a name="14"></a> <h2>Question and Answer <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#14">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>Question and answer verification is useful if you know your buddy but have not established a shared secret nor had a chance to share fingerprints. This method is useful to establish verification based on something both of you know, like a shared event or memory. This only works if both of you are using Pidgin.</p>
<p>Enter the question you want to ask. Don't make it so simple that someone can guess it easily, but don't make it impossible. An example of a good question would be “Where did we go for dinner in Minneapolis?” And example of a bad question would be “Can you buy apples in Tokyo?”</p>
<p class="warning">The answers must match exactly; so keep that in mind when choosing an answer to your question. Capitalization matters, so you might consider a note in parentheses like (for example: use capitals, lower case).</p>
<p>Enter the question and answer then click the “Authenticate” button.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2014/12/05/how_to_use_otr_-_41.png" width="413" height="424" /></p>
<p>Your buddy will have a window open with the question displayed asking for the answer. They will have to answer and click the “Authenticate” button. Then they will receive a message letting them know if the authentication was successful.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/field/image/how_to_use_otr_-_42.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/field/image/how_to_use_otr_-_43.png" /></p>
<p>Once your buddy had completed the authentication procedure, you will get a window letting you know the authentication succeeded.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2014/10/17/authenticatin_buddy.png" /></p>
<p>Your buddy should also verify your account so that both of you can be sure that the communication is secure. Here is what it would like for Akiko and Boris. Notice the green “Private” icons in the lower right of the chat window.</p>
