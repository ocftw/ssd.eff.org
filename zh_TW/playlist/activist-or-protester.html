But, do not fear! Security is a process, and through thoughtful planning, you can assess what’s right for you. Security isn’t about the tools you use or the software you download. It begins with understanding the unique threats you face and how you can counter those threats.</p>
<p>In computer security, a <a href="../glossary/threat.html" class="glossify-link" title="In computer security, a threat is a potential event that could undermine your efforts to defend your data. Threats can be intentional (conceived by attackers), or they could be accidental (you might leave your computer turned on and unguarded). ">threat<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a> is a potential event that could undermine your efforts to defend your data. You can counter the threats you face by determining what you need to protect and from whom you need to protect it. This process is called “threat modeling.”</p>
<p>This guide will teach you how to <a href="../glossary/threat-model.html" class="glossify-link" title="A way of narrowly thinking about the sorts of protection you want for your data. It's impossible to protect against every kind of trick or attacker, so you should concentrate on which people might want your data, what they might want from it, and how they might get it. Coming up with a set of possible attacks you plan to protect against is called threat modeling. Once you have a threat model, you can conduct a risk analysis. ">threat model<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a>, or how to assess your risks for your digital information and how to determine what solutions are best for you.</p>
<p>What might threat modeling look like? Let’s say you want to keep your house and possessions safe, here are a few questions you might ask:</p>
<p><strong><em>What do I have inside my home that is worth protecting?</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>Assets could include: jewelry, electronics, financial documents, passports, or photos</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>Who do I want to protect it from?</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>Adversaries could include: burglars, roommates, or guests</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>How likely is it that I will need to protect it?</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>Does my neighborhood have a history of burglaries? How trustworthy are my roommates/guests? What are the capabilities of my adversaries? What are the risks I should consider?</li>
</ul><p><em><strong>How bad are the consequences if I fail?</strong></em></p>
<ul><li>Do I have anything in my house that I cannot replace? Do I have the time or money to replace these things? Do I have insurance that covers goods stolen from my home?</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>How much trouble am I willing to go through to prevent these consequences?</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>Am I willing to buy a safe for sensitive documents? Can I afford to buy a high-quality lock? Do I have time to open a security box at my local bank and keep my valuables there?</li>
</ul><p>Once you have asked yourself these questions, you are in a position to assess what measures to take. If your possessions are valuable, but the risk of a break-in is low, then you may not want to invest too much money in a lock. But, if the risk is high, you’ll want to get the best lock on the market, and consider adding a security system.</p>
<p>Building a threat model helps you to understand the unique threats you face, your assets, your <a href="../glossary/adversary.html" class="glossify-link" title="Your adversary is the person or organization attempting to undermine your security goals. Adversaries can be different, depending on the situation. For instance, you may worry about criminals spying on the network at a cafe, or your classmates at a school. Often the adversary is hypothetical. ">adversary<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a>, your adversary’s capabilities, and the likelihood of risks you face.</p>

<p>Threat modeling helps you identify threats to the things you value and determine from whom you need to protect them. When building a <a href="../glossary/threat-model.html" class="glossify-link" title="A way of narrowly thinking about the sorts of protection you want for your data. It's impossible to protect against every kind of trick or attacker, so you should concentrate on which people might want your data, what they might want from it, and how they might get it. Coming up with a set of possible attacks you plan to protect against is called threat modeling. Once you have a threat model, you can conduct a risk analysis. ">threat model<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a>, answer these five questions:</p>
<ol><li>What do I want to protect?</li>
<li>Who do I want to protect it from?</li>
<li>How bad are the consequences if I fail?</li>
<li>How likely is it that I will need to protect it?</li>
<li>How much trouble am I willing to go through to try to prevent potential consequences?</li>
</ol><p>Let’s take a closer look at each of these questions.</p>
<h3>What do I want to protect?</h3>
<p>An “<a href="../glossary/asset.html" class="glossify-link" title="In threat modeling, any piece of data or a device that needs to be protected. ">asset<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a>” is something you value and want to protect. In the context of digital security, an asset is usually some kind of information. For example, your emails, contact lists, instant messages, location, and files are all possible assets. Your devices may also be assets.</p>
<p><em>Make a list of your assets: data that you keep, where it’s kept, who has access to it, and what stops others from accessing it.</em></p>
<h3>Who do I want to protect it from?</h3>
<p>To answer this question, it’s important to identify who might want to target you or your information. A person or entity that poses a threat to your assets is an “<a href="../glossary/adversary.html" class="glossify-link" title="Your adversary is the person or organization attempting to undermine your security goals. Adversaries can be different, depending on the situation. For instance, you may worry about criminals spying on the network at a cafe, or your classmates at a school. Often the adversary is hypothetical. ">adversary<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a>.” Examples of potential adversaries are your boss, your former partner, your business competition, your government, or a hacker on a public network.</p>
<p><em>Make a list of your adversaries, or those who might want to get ahold of your assets. Your list may include individuals, a government agency, or corporations.</em></p>
<p class="warning">Depending on who your adversaries are, under some circumstances this list might be something you want to destroy after you’re done threat modeling.</p>
<h3>How bad are the consequences if I fail?</h3>
<p>There are many ways that an adversary can threaten your data. For example, an adversary can read your private communications as they pass through the network, or they can delete or corrupt your data.</p>
<p>The motives of adversaries differ widely, as do their attacks. A government trying to prevent the spread of a video showing police violence may be content to simply delete or reduce the availability of that video. In contrast, a political opponent may wish to gain access to secret content and publish that content without you knowing.</p>
<p>Threat modeling involves understanding how bad the consequences could be if an adversary successfully attacks one of your assets. To determine this, you should consider the <a href="../glossary/capability.html" class="glossify-link" title="The capability of an attacker (in the sense we use it in this guide) is what it is able to do to achieve its aims. For example, a country's security services might have the capability to listen to telephone calls while a neighbor may have the capability to watch you from their window. To say that an attacker “has&quot; a capability does not mean that they will necessarily use that capability. It does mean that you should consider and prepare for the possibility. ">capability<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a> of your adversary. For example, your mobile phone provider has access to all your phone records and thus has the capability to use that data against you. A hacker on an open Wi-Fi network can access your unencrypted communications. Your government might have stronger capabilities.</p>
<p><em>Write down what your adversary might want to do with your private data.</em></p>
<h3>How likely is it that I will need to protect it?</h3>
<p>Risk is the likelihood that a particular threat against a particular asset will actually occur. It goes hand-in-hand with capability. While your mobile phone provider has the capability to access all of your data, the risk of them posting your private data online to harm your reputation is low.</p>
<p>It is important to distinguish between threats and risks. While a threat is a bad thing that can happen, risk is the likelihood that the threat will occur. For instance, there is a threat that your building might collapse, but the risk of this happening is far greater in San Francisco (where earthquakes are common) than in Stockholm (where they are not).</p>
<p>Conducting a <a href="../glossary/risk-analysis.html" class="glossify-link" title="In computer security, risk analysis is calculating the chance that threats might succeed, so you know how much effort to spend defending against them. There may be many different ways that you might lose control or access to your data, but some of them are less likely than others. Assessing risk means deciding which threats you are going to take seriously, and which may be too rare or too harmless (or too difficult to combat) to worry about. See threat modeling. ">risk analysis<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a> is both a personal and a subjective process; not everyone has the same priorities or views threats in the same way. Many people find certain threats unacceptable no matter what the risk, because the mere presence of the threat at any likelihood is not worth the cost. In other cases, people disregard high risks because they don't view the threat as a problem.</p>
<p><em>Write down which threats you are going to take seriously, and which may be too rare or too harmless (or too difficult to combat) to worry about.</em></p>
<h3>How much trouble am I willing to go through to try to prevent potential consequences?</h3>
<p>Answering this question requires conducting the risk analysis. Not everyone has the same priorities or views threats in the same way.</p>
<p>For example, an attorney representing a client in a national security case would probably be willing to go to greater lengths to protect communications about that case, such as using encrypted email, than a mother who regularly emails her daughter funny cat videos.</p>
<p><em>Write down what options you have available to you to help mitigate your unique threats. Note if you have any financial constraints, technical constraints, or social constraints.</em></p>

<p>What does transport-layer encryption do and why might you need it? HTTPS, also referred to as SSL or TLS, encrypts your communications so that it cannot be read by other people on your network. This can include the other people using the same Wi-Fi in an airport or at a café, the other people at your office or school, the administrators at your ISP, malicious hackers, governments, or law enforcement officials. Communications sent over your web browser, including the web pages that you visit and the content of your emails, blog posts, and messages, using HTTP rather than HTTPS are trivial for an attacker to intercept and read.</p>
<p>HTTPS is the most basic level of encryption for your web browsing that we recommend for everybody. It is as basic as putting on your seat belt when you drive.</p>
<p>But there are some things that HTTPS does not do. When you send email using HTTPS, your email provider still gets an unencrypted copy of your communication. Governments and law enforcement may be able to access this data with a warrant. In the United States, most email providers have a policy that says they will tell you when you have received a government request for your user data as long as they are legally allowed to do so, but these policies are strictly voluntary, and in many cases providers are legally prevented from informing their users of requests for data. Some email providers, such as Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft, publish transparency reports, detailing the number of government requests for user data they receive, which countries make the requests, and how often the company has complied by turning over data.</p>

On the other hand, if you're already using Windows, you are already trusting Microsoft to the same extent.

At the time this guide was updated, we do not have a full disk encryption tool for versions of Windows that do not include BitLocker that we can recommend.</p>
<p>Whatever your device calls it, encryption is only as good as your password. If your attacker has your device, they have all the time in the world to try out new passwords. Forensic software can try millions of passwords a second. That means that a four number pin is unlikely to protect your data for very long at all, and even a long password may merely slow down your attacker. A really strong password under these conditions should be over fifteen characters long.</p>
<p>Most of us are not realistically going to learn and enter such passphrases on our phones or mobile devices. So while encryption can be useful to prevent casual access, you should preserve truly confidential data by keeping it hidden from physical access by attackers, or cordoned away on a much more secure machine.</p>
</div><div class="field-item odd"><a name="1"></a> <h2>Create a Secure Machine <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#1">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>Maintaining a secure environment can be hard work. At best, you have to change passwords, habits, and perhaps the software you use on your main computer or device. At worst, you have to constantly think about whether you're leaking confidential information or using unsafe practices. Even when you know the problems, some solutions may be out of your hands. Other people might require you to continue unsafe digital security practices even after you have explained the dangers. For instance, work colleagues might want you to continue to open email attachments from them, even though you know your attackers could impersonate them and send you <a href="../glossary/malware.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="malware" title="Malware is short for malicious software: programs that are designed to conduct unwanted actions on your device.

Or you may be concerned that your main computer has already been compromised.</p>
<p>One strategy to consider is cordoning off valuable data and communications onto a more secure computer. Use that machine only occasionally, and when you do, consciously take much more care over your actions. If you need to open attachments, or use insecure software, do it on another machine.</p>
<p class="tip">If you're setting up a secure machine, what extra steps can you take to make it secure?</p>
<p>You can almost certainly keep the device in a more physically safe place: somewhere where you are able to tell if it has been tampered with, such as a locked cabinet.</p>
<p>You can install a privacy- and security-focused <a href="../glossary/operating-system.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="operating system" title="A program that runs all the other programs on a computer.

You might not be able (or want) to use an open source operating system in your everyday work, but if you just need to store, edit and write confidential emails or instant messages from this secure device, Tails will work well, and defaults to high security settings.</p>
<p>An extra, secure computer may not be as expensive an option as you think. A computer that is seldom used, and only runs a few programs, does not need to be particularly fast or new. You can buy an older netbook for a fraction of the price of a modern laptop or phone. Older machines also have the advantage that secure software like Tails may be more likely to work with them than newer models.</p>
<p>You can use the secure machine to keep the primary copy of confidential data. A secure machine can be valuable in cordoning off private data in this way, but you should also consider a couple of extra risks it might create.

<p>The highest level of protection from Internet attacks or online surveillance is, not surprisingly, not connecting to the Internet at all. You could make sure your secure computer never connects to a local network or Wifi, and only copy files onto the machine using physical media, like DVDs or USB drives. In network security, this is known as having an "<a href="../glossary/air-gap.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="air gap" title="A computer or network that is physically isolated from all other networks, including the Internet, is said to be air-gapped.

<p>If you do use the secure device to connect to the Internet, you might choose not to log in or use your usual accounts.

<p class="tip">A variation on the idea of a secure machine is to have an <em>insecure machine: </em>a device that you only use when you are going into dangerous places or need to try a risky operation. Many journalists and activists, for instance, take a minimal netbook with them when they travel. This computer does not have any of their documents, usual contact or email information on it, and so is less of a loss if it is confiscated or scanned. You can apply the same strategy to mobile phones.

<p>Reusing passwords is an exceptionally bad security practice. If a bad actor gets ahold of a password that you've reused across multiple services, they can gain access to many of your accounts. This is why having multiple, strong, unique passwords is so important.</p>

<p class="tip"><em>Wait, aren’t we supposed to keep passwords in our heads and never write them down?</em> Actually, writing them down, and keeping them somewhere like your wallet, is useful so you’ll at least know if your written passwords go missing or get stolen.</p>

</ul><p>One of many difficulties when people choose passwords themselves is that <a href="http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~nick/aaronson-oracle/" rel="noreferrer">people aren't very good at making random, unpredictable choices</a>. An effective way of creating a <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/new-wordlists-random-passphrases">strong and memorable password</a> is to use <a href="https://www.eff.org/dice">dice</a> and a <a href="https://www.eff.org/files/2016/07/18/eff_large_wordlist.txt">word list</a> to randomly choose words. Together, these words form your “passphrase.” A "passphrase" is a type of password that is longer for added security. For disk encryption and your password manager, we recommend selecting a minimum of six words.</p>
<p><em>Why use a minimum of six words? Why use dice to pick words in a phrase randomly?</em> The longer and more random the password, the harder it is for both computers and humans to guess. To find out why you need such a long, hard-to-guess password, here’s a <a href="../module/animated-overview-how-make-super-secure-password-using-dice.html">video explainer</a>.</p>
<p class="tip">Try making a passphrase using one of EFF's <a href="https://www.eff.org/dice">word lists.</a></p>
<p>If your computer or device gets compromised and spyware is installed, the spyware can watch you type your <a href="../glossary/master-password.html" class="glossify-link" title="A password used to unlock a store of other passwords or other ways to unlock programs or messages.

</div><div class="field-item even"><a name="2"></a> <h2>A Word About “Security Questions” <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#2">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>Beware of the “security questions” that websites use to confirm your identity. Honest answers to these questions are often publicly discoverable facts that a determined <a href="../glossary/adversary.html" class="glossify-link" title="Your adversary is the person or organization attempting to undermine your security goals.

<p>Instead, give fictional answers that no one knows but you. For example, if the <a href="../glossary/security-question.html" class="glossify-link" title="To supplement passwords, some systems use &quot;security questions.&quot; These are queries to which only you are supposed to know the answer. The problem with security questions is that they are really just extra passwords that have potentially guessable or discoverable answers. We recommend you treat them as any other password: create a long, novel, random, phrase to answer them, and record that somewhere safe. So the next time your bank asks you your mother's maiden name, you should be ready to answer &quot;Correct Battery Horse Staple&quot; or similar. ">security question<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a> asks:</p>
<p><em>“What was the name of your first pet?”</em></p>
<p>Your answer could be a random password generated from your <a href="../glossary/password-manager.html" class="glossify-link" title="A tool that can encrypt and store your passwords using a single master password making it practical to use many different passwords on different sites and services without having to memorize them. ">password manager<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a>. You can store these fictional answers in your password manager.</p>
<p class="tip">Think of sites where you’ve used security questions and consider changing your responses. Do not use the same passwords or security question answers for multiple accounts on different websites or services.</p>
</div><div class="field-item odd"><a name="3"></a> <h2>Syncing Your Passwords Across Multiple Devices <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#3">Anchor link</a></h2>

This means when you sync your password file on one device, it will update it on all of your devices.</p>
<p>Password managers can store your passwords “in the cloud,” meaning encrypted on a remote server. When you need your passwords, these managers will retrieve and <a href="../glossary/decrypt.html" class="glossify-link" title="Make a secret message or data intelligible.

<p>If this is concerning, don't sync your passwords to the cloud and instead opt to store them on just your devices.</p>
<p class="tip">Keep a backup of your password database just in case. Having a backup is useful if you lose your password database in a crash, or if your device is taken away from you. Password managers usually have a way to make a backup file, or you can use your regular backup program.</p>

The second factor could be a one-off secret code, a number generated by a program running on a mobile device, or a device that you carry and that you can use to confirm who you are. Companies like banks, and major internet services like Google, Paypal and Twitter now offer two-factor authentication. ">two-factor authentication<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a>.</p>
<p>Some services offer two-factor authentication (also called 2FA, multi-factor authentication, or two-step verification), which requires users to possess two components (a <a href="../glossary/password.html" class="glossify-link" title="A secret meant to be memorized, and meant to limit access to something so that only someone who knows the password can gain access.

<p>Two-factor authentication using a mobile phone can be done in one of two ways:</p>
<ul><li>your phone can run an authenticator application that generates security codes (such as <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en" rel="noreferrer">Google Authenticator</a> or <a href="https://authy.com/" rel="noreferrer">Authy</a>) or you can use a stand-alone hardware device (such as a YubiKey); or</li>
<li>the service can send you an SMS text message with an extra security code that you need to type in whenever you log in.</li>
</ul><p class="tip">If you have a choice, pick the authenticator application or stand-alone hardware device instead of receiving codes by text message. It’s easier for an attacker to redirect these codes to their own phone than it is to bypass the authenticator.</p>
<p>Some services, such as Google, also allow you to generate a list of one-time passwords, also called single-use passwords. These are meant to be printed or written down on paper and carried with you. Each of these passwords works only once, so if one is stolen by spyware when you enter it, the thief won't be able to use it for anything in the future.</p>
<p class="tip">If you or your organization run your own communications infrastructure, there's free software available that can be used to enable two-factor authentication for accessing your systems.

In some cases, getting that one shot of the riot police coming right at you posted somewhere on the Internet is an exceptionally powerful act and can draw vital attention to your cause. The following are useful tips for you to remember if you find yourself at a protest and are concerned about protecting your electronic devices if or when you’re questioned, detained, or arrested by police. Remember that these tips are general guidelines, so if you have specific concerns, please talk to an attorney.</p>
<p class="tip">For our guide to attending protests within the United States, click <a href="../module/attending-protests-united-states.html">here</a>.</p>
</div><div class="field-item odd"><a name="1"></a> <h2>Preparing Your Personal Devices for a Protest <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#1">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>Think carefully about what’s on your phone before bringing it to a protest. Your phone contains a wealth of private data, which can include your list of contacts, the people you have recently called, your text messages and email, photos and video, GPS location data, your web browsing history and passwords, and the contents of your social media accounts. Through stored passwords or active logins, access to the device can allow someone to obtain yet even more information on remote servers. (You can log out of these services).</p>
<p>In many countries, people are required to register their SIM cards when they purchase a mobile phone. If you take your mobile phone with you to a protest, it makes it easy for the government to figure out that you are there. If you need to keep your participation in a protest secret from governments or law enforcement, cover your face so that it is harder to identify you from photos. However, do note that masks may get you into trouble in some locations due to anti-mask laws. Also, <em>do not take your mobile phone with you.</em> If you absolutely must bring a mobile phone with you, try to bring one that is not registered in your name.</p>
<p>To protect your rights, you may want to harden your existing phone against searches. You should also consider bringing a throwaway or alternate phone to the protest that does not contain sensitive data, which you’ve never used to log in to your communications or social media accounts, and which you would not mind losing or parting with for a while. If you have a lot of sensitive or personal information on your phone, the latter might be a better option.</p>
<p><strong><a href="../glossary/password.html" class="glossify-link" title="A secret meant to be memorized, and meant to limit access to something so that only someone who knows the password can gain access. It might limit access to an online account, a device, or something else. A long password based on multiple words may also be called a &quot;passphrase&quot; to remind us that it's not just one &quot;word.&quot; A main password to unlock other passwords in a password manager or password safe application is often called a &quot;master password.” ">Password<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a>-protection and <a href="../glossary/encryption.html" class="glossify-link" title="A process that takes a message and makes it unreadable except to a person who knows how to &quot;decrypt&quot; it back into a readable form. ">encryption<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a> options</strong>: Always password-protect your phone. But while password-protecting your phone is a small barrier to access, please be aware that merely password-protecting or locking your phone is <em>not</em> an effective barrier to expert forensic analysis. <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/141953/how-to-encrypt-your-android-phone-and-why-you-might-want-to/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Android</a> and <a href="../module/how-encrypt-your-iphone.html#overlay=en/node/48/" target="_blank">iPhone</a> both provide options for full-disk encryption on their operating<strong> </strong>systems, and you should use them, though the safest option remains leaving the phone elsewhere.</p>
<p>One problem with mobile phone encryption is that on Android the same password is used for disk encryption and screen unlocking. This was a bad design, because it forces the user to either select a too-weak password for the encryption, or to type a too-long and inconvenient password for the screen. The best compromise may be 8-12 fairly random characters that are nonetheless easy to type quickly on your particular device. Or if you have root access to your Android phone and know how to use a shell, read <a href="https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=29468" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a> for instructions on how to set up a separate (longer) password for full-disk encryption. <em>(See also "<a href="../module/communicating-others.html#overlay=en/node/43/" target="_blank">Communicating with Others</a>” for details on how to <a href="../glossary/encrypt.html" class="glossify-link" title="To apply encryption technology to any sort of information or communication. This transforms the information or communication mathematically so that it seems meaningless, but can still be restored to its original form by a person or device that possesses the right secret key. This limits who can access the information because without the right secret key, it should be impossible to reverse the encryption and recover the original information. Encryption is one of several technologies that make up the field called cryptography. ">encrypt<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a> text and voice calls.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Back up your data</strong>: It’s important that you frequently back up the data stored on your phone, especially if your device lands into the hands of a police officer. You may not get your phone back for a while (if at all) and it is possible that its contents may be deleted, whether intentionally or not.</p>
<p>For similar reasons, consider writing one important, but non-incriminating phone number on your body with a permanent marker in case you lose your phone, but are permitted to make a call.</p>
<p><strong>Cell site location information:</strong> If you take your mobile phone with you to a protest, it makes it easy for the government to figure out that you are there by seeking the information from your provider. (<a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/cell-tracking" target="_blank">We believe</a> that governments should obtain an individualized warrant to obtain location information, but governments often disagree). If you need to keep the fact of your participation in a protest from the government, do not take your mobile phone with you. If you absolutely must bring a mobile phone with you, try to bring one that is not registered in your name.</p>
<p>If you are concerned about being arrested at the protest, it’s best practice to pre-arrange a message to a trusted friend who is in a safe place. Write your text message to that person in advance and queue it up so that you can send it quickly in case of an emergency to let them know you have been arrested. Similarly, you may want to plan a pre-arranged call after the protest with a friend—if they don’t hear from you, they can assume you’ve been arrested.</p>
<p>In addition to being made aware that your phone has been seized and you have been arrested, that trusted friend might be able to change the passwords to your email and social media accounts in case you are coerced into giving up your passwords to the authorities.</p>
<p class="warning">Please note that deliberately concealing or destroying evidence may be considered an illegal act in itself in some jurisdictions (including many social democracies).</p>
<p>Be sure you and your friend understand the law and the risks before engaging in this plan. For instance, if you are protesting in a country with a strong tradition of the rule of law and where protesting in itself is not a crime, it may be that conspiring to lock out law enforcement from your accounts may lead to you breaking the law when previously you would be able to leave without charge. On the other hand, if you are concerned for the physical safety of you and your colleagues at the hands of a unchecked militia, protecting your friends’ identities and your own data from them may be a greater priority than complying with an investigation.</p>
</div><div class="field-item even"><a name="2"></a> <h2>You’re at the Protest—Now What? <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#2">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>Once you are at the protest, keep in mind that law enforcement may be monitoring communications in the area. You may wish to <a href="../glossary/encrypt.html" class="glossify-link" title="To apply encryption technology to any sort of information or communication.

<p class="warning">Please remember that even if your communications are encrypted, your <a href="../glossary/metadata.html" class="glossify-link" title="Metadata (or &quot;data about data&quot;) is everything about a piece of information, apart from the information itself.

Legal systems often protect content more than metadata: for instance, in the United States, law enforcement needs a warrant to listen to a person's telephone calls, but claims the right to obtain the list of who you have called far more easily. However, metadata can often reveal a great deal, and will often need to be protected as carefully as the data it describes. ">metadata<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a> is not; your mobile phone will still give away your location and the metadata about your communications, such as whom you are talking to and for how long.</p>

</div><div class="field-item odd"><a name="1"></a> <h2>Protect your Phone Before you Protest <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#1">Anchor link</a></h2>

<p>Your phone contains a wealth of private data, which can include your list of contacts, the people you have recently called, your text messages and email, photos and video, GPS location data, your web browsing history and passwords or active logins, and the contents of your email and social media accounts. Through stored passwords, access to the device can allow someone to obtain yet even more information on remote servers.</p>
<p>The United States Supreme Court recently held that the police are required to get a warrant to obtain this information when someone is arrested, but <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/supreme-court-sets-powerful-limits-cell-searches-fails-protect-internet-streaming" target="_blank">the exact limits of that ruling are still being examined</a>. In addition, sometimes law enforcement will seek to seize a phone because they believe it contains evidence of a crime (such as photos you may have taken of the protest), or as part of a vehicle search. They can then later get a warrant to examine the phone that they’ve already seized.</p>
<p>To protect your rights, you may want to harden your existing phone against searches. You should also consider bringing a throwaway or alternate phone to the protest that does not contain sensitive data, which you’ve never used to log in to your communications or social media accounts, and which you would not mind losing or parting with for a while.

<p><strong>Maintain control over your phone: </strong>Maintaining control might mean keeping your phone on you at all times, or handing it over to a trusted friend if you are engaging in action that you think might lead to your arrest.</p>
<p><strong>Consider taking pictures and video: </strong>Just knowing that there are cameras documenting the event can be enough to discourage police misconduct during the protest. EFF believes that you have the First Amendment right to document public protests, including police action.

<p>If you are concerned about being identified, cover your face so that you cannot be identified from photos. Masks may get you into trouble in some locations due to <a href="http://www.anapsid.org/cnd/mcs/maskcodes.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">anti-mask laws</a>.</p>
</div><div class="field-item odd"><a name="3"></a> <h2>Help! Help! I’m Being Arrested <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#3">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p class="tip">Remember that you have a right to remain silent—about your phone and anything else<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>If questioned by police, you can politely but firmly ask to speak to your attorney and politely but firmly request that all further questioning stop until your attorney is present. It is best to say nothing at all until you have a chance to talk to a lawyer. However, if you do decide to answer questions, be sure to tell the truth. It is likely a crime to lie to a police officer and you may find yourself in more trouble for lying to law enforcement than for whatever it was they wanted on your computer.</p>
<p>If the police ask to see your phone, you can tell them you do not consent to the search of the device. They might still be able to search your phone with a warrant after they arrest you, but at least it’s clear that you did not give them permission to do so.</p>
<p>If the police ask for the <a href="../glossary/password.html" class="glossify-link" title="A secret meant to be memorized, and meant to limit access to something so that only someone who knows the password can gain access.

If the police ask if a phone is yours, you can tell them that it is lawfully in your possession without admitting or denying ownership or control. Every arrest situation is different, and you will need an attorney to help you sort through your particular circumstance.</p>
<p>Ask your attorney about the Fifth Amendment, which protects you from being forced to give the government self-incriminating testimony. If turning over an <a href="../glossary/encryption.html" class="glossify-link" title="A process that takes a message and makes it unreadable except to a person who knows how to &quot;decrypt&quot; it back into a readable form. ">encryption<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a><strong> </strong><a href="../glossary/key.html" class="glossify-link" title="In cryptography, a piece of data which gives you the capability to encrypt or decrypt a message.

If turning over an <a href="../glossary/encryption-key.html" class="glossify-link" title="An encryption key is a piece of information that is used to convert a message into an unreadable form. In some cases, you need the same encryption key to decode the message. In others, the encryption key and decryption key are different.

If, however, turning over passwords and encryption keys will not result in a “testimonial act,” for instance demonstrating that you have control over the data, then the Fifth Amendment may not protect you. Your attorney can help you figure out how this applies in a particular situation.</p>
<p>And just because the police cannot compel you to give up your password, doesn’t mean that they can’t pressure you. The police may detain you and you may go to jail rather than being immediately released if they think you’re refusing to be cooperative. You will need to decide whether to comply.</p>
</div><div class="field-item even"><a name="4"></a> <h2>The Police Have my Phone, How do I Get it Back? <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#4">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>If your phone or electronic device was illegally seized, and is not promptly returned when you are released, you can have your attorney file a motion with the court to have your property returned. If the police believe that evidence of a crime was found on your electronic device, including in your photos or videos, the police can keep it as evidence. They may also attempt to make you forfeit your electronic device, but you can challenge that in court.</p>
<p>Cell phones and other electronic devices are an essential component of 21st century protests. Everyone in the United States, both citizens and non-citizens, can and should exercise their First Amendment right to free speech and assembly, and hopefully the above tips can be a useful guide for you to intelligently manage the risks to your property and privacy.</p>

<p>But given the large number of companies and websites offering secure programs or hardware, how do you choose the one that's right for you?</p>
</div><div class="field-item odd"><a name="1"></a> <h2><a id="Security" name="Security"></a>Security is a Process, not a Purchase <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#1">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>The first thing to remember before changing the software you use or buying new tools is that no tool is going to give you absolute protection from surveillance in all circumstances. Using <a href="../glossary/encryption.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="encryption" title="A process that takes a message and makes it unreadable except to a person who knows how to &quot;decrypt&quot; it back into a readable form.

">encryption<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/themes/ssd/img/info.png" /></a> software will generally make it harder for others to read your communications or go through your computer's files. But attacks on your digital security will always seek out the weakest element of your security practices. When you use a new secure tool, you should think about how using it might affect other ways someone could target you. For example, if you decide to use a secure texting program to talk to a contact because you know that your phone might be compromised, might the fact that you're using this program at all give an <a href="../glossary/adversary.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="adversary" title="Your adversary is the person or organization attempting to undermine your security goals. Adversaries can be different, depending on the situation. For instance, you may worry about criminals spying on the network at a cafe, or your classmates at a school. Often the adversary is hypothetical.

Often the adversary is hypothetical. ">adversary<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/themes/ssd/img/info.png" /></a> a clue that you are talking about private information?</p>
<p>Secondly, remember your <a href="../glossary/threat-model.html">threat model</a>. You don't need to buy some expensive encrypted phone system that claims to be “NSA-proof” if your biggest <a href="../glossary/threat.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="threat" title="In computer security, a threat is a potential event that could undermine your efforts to defend your data.

">threat<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/themes/ssd/img/info.png" /></a> is physical surveillance from a private investigator with no access to internet surveillance tools. Alternatively, if you are facing a government that regularly jails dissidents <em>because</em> they use encryption tools, it may make sense to use simpler tricks—like a set of pre-arranged codes—rather than risk leaving evidence that you use encryption software on your laptop.</p>
<p>Given all that, here are some questions you can ask about a tool before downloading, purchasing, or using it.</p>
</div><div class="field-item even"><a name="2"></a> <h2><a id="Transparent" name="Transparent"></a>How Transparent is it? <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#2">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>Even though digital security seems to be mostly about keeping secrets, there's a strong belief among security researchers that openness and transparency leads to more secure tools.</p>
<p>Much of the software used and recommended by the digital security community is open source, which is to say that the code that defines how it works is publicly available for others to examine, modify, and share. By being transparent about how their program works, the creators of these tools invite others to look for security flaws, and help improve the program.</p>
<p>Open software provides the opportunity for better security but does not guarantee it. The open source advantage relies in part on a community of technologists actually checking the code, which for small projects (and even for popular, complex ones) may be hard to achieve. When you're considering using a tool, see if its source code is available, and whether the code has an independent security audit to confirm the quality of its security. At the very least, software or hardware should have a detailed technical explanation of how it functions, for other experts to inspect.</p>
</div><div class="field-item odd"><a name="3"></a> <h2><a id="Clarity" name="Clarity"></a>How Clear are its Creators About its Advantages and Disadvantages? <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#3">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>No software or hardware is entirely secure. Creators or sellers who are honest about the limitations of their product will give you a much stronger idea of whether their application is appropriate for you.</p>
<p class="warning">Don't trust blanket statements that say that the code is “military-grade” or “NSA-proof”; these mean nothing and give a strong warning that the creators are overconfident or unwilling to consider the possible failings in their product.</p>
<p>Because attackers are always trying to discover new ways to break the security of tools, software and hardware often needs to be updated to fix new vulnerabilities. It can be a serious problem if the creators of a tool are unwilling to do this, either because they fear bad publicity, or because they have not built the infrastructure to fix problems.</p>
<p>You can't predict the future, but a good indicator of how toolmakers will behave in the future is their past activity. If the tool's website lists previous issues and links to regular updates and information—like specifically how long it has been since the software was last updated—you can be more confident that they will continue to provide this service in the future.</p>
</div><div class="field-item even"><a name="4"></a> <h2><a id="Compromised" name="Compromised"></a>What Happens if the Creators are Compromised? <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#4">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>When security toolmakers build software and hardware, they (just like you) must have a clear <a href="../glossary/threat-model.html">threat model</a>. The best creators will explicitly describe what kind of attackers they can protect you from in their documentation.</p>
<p>But there's one attacker that many manufacturers do not want to think about: what if they, themselves, are compromised or decide to <a href="../glossary/attack.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="attack" title="In computer security, an attack is a method that can be used to compromise security, or its actual use. An attacker is the person or organization using an attack. An attack method is sometimes called an &quot;exploit.&quot; " data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" data-html="true" data-toggle="popover" data-container="body" data-content="In computer security, an attack is a method that can be used to compromise security, or its actual use. An attacker is the person or organization using an attack. An attack method is sometimes called an &quot;exploit.&quot; ">attack<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/themes/ssd/img/info.png" /></a> their own users. For instance, a court or government may compel a company to give up personal data or create a “backdoor” that will remove all the protections their tool offers. You may want to consider the jurisdiction(s) where the creators are based. If your <a href="../glossary/threat.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="threat" title="In computer security, a threat is a potential event that could undermine your efforts to defend your data. Threats can be intentional (conceived by attackers), or they could be accidental (you might leave your computer turned on and unguarded).

Threats can be intentional (conceived by attackers), or they could be accidental (you might leave your computer turned on and unguarded). ">threat<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/themes/ssd/img/info.png" /></a> is from the government of Iran, for example, a US-based company will be able to resist Iranian court orders, even if it must comply with US orders.</p>
<p>Even if a creator is able to resist government pressure, an attacker may attempt to achieve the same result by breaking into the toolmakers' own systems in order to attack its customers.</p>
<p>The most resilient tools are those that consider this as a possible attack, and are designed to defend against this. Look for language that asserts that a creator cannot access private data, rather than promises that a creator <em>will</em> not. Look for institutions with a <a href="https://www.eff.org/who-has-your-back-government-data-requests-2014" target="_blank">reputation for fighting court orders for personal data</a>.</p>
</div><div class="field-item odd"><a name="5"></a> <h2><a id="Recalls" name="Recalls"></a>Check for Recalls and Online Criticism <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#5">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>Of course, companies selling products and enthusiasts advertising their latest software can be misled, be misleading, or even outright lie. A product that was originally secure might be discovered to have terrible flaws in the future. Make sure you stay well-informed on the latest news about the tools that you use.</p>
</div><div class="field-item even"><a name="6"></a> <h2><a id="Sametool" name="Sametool"></a>Do you Know Others who Use the Same Tool? <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#6">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>It's a lot of work for one person to keep up with the latest news about a tool. If you have colleagues who use a particular product or service, work with them to stay informed about what's happening.</p>
</div><div class="field-item odd"><a name="7"></a> <h2><a id="Products" name="Products"></a>Products Mentioned in This Guide <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#7">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>We try to ensure that the software and hardware we mention in this guide complies with the criteria we've listed above: we have made a good faith effort to only list products that have a solid grounding in what we currently know about digital security, are generally transparent about their operation (and their failings), have defenses against the possibility that the creators themselves will be compromised, and are currently maintained, with a large and technically-knowledgeable user base. We believe that they have, at the time of writing, the eye of a wide audience who is examining them for flaws, and would raise concerns to the public quickly. Please understand that we do not have the resources to examine or make independent assurances about their security, we are not endorsing these products and cannot guarantee complete security.</p>
</div><div class="field-item even"><a name="8"></a> <h2><a id="Which_device" name="Which_device"></a>Which Phone Should I Buy? Which Computer? <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#8">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>One of the most frequent questions asked of security trainers is “Should I buy Android or an iPhone?” or “Should I use a PC or a Mac?” or “What <a href="../glossary/operating-system.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="operating system" title="A program that runs all the other programs on a computer. Windows, Android and Apple's OS X and iOS are all examples of operating systems.

Windows, Android and Apple's OS X and iOS are all examples of operating systems. ">operating system<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/themes/ssd/img/info.png" /></a> should I use?” There are no simple answers to these questions. The relative safety of software and devices is constantly shifting as new flaws are discovered and old bugs are fixed. Companies may compete with each other to provide you with better security, or they may all be under pressure from governments to weaken that security.</p>
<p>Some general advice is almost always true, however. When you buy a device or an operating system, keep current with its software updates. Updates will often fix security problems in older code that attacks can exploit. Older phones and operating systems are no longer supported, even for security updates. In particular, Microsoft has made it clear that Windows XP and earlier Windows versions will not receive fixes for even severe security problems. If you use XP, you cannot expect it to be secure from attackers. (The same is true for OS X before 10.7.5 or "Lion").</p>

<p>Governments, companies, schools, and Internet providers sometimes use software to prevent their users from accessing certain websites and services. This is called <a href="../glossary/internet-filtering.html" class="glossify-link" title="Filtering is the politer term for blocking or censoring Internet traffic. ">Internet filtering<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a> or blocking, and it is a form of censorship. Filtering comes in different forms. Censors can block individual web pages, or even entire websites. Sometimes, content is blocked based on the keywords it contains.</p>
<p>There are different ways of beating Internet censorship. Some protect you from surveillance, but many do not. When someone who controls your net connection filters or blocks a site, you can almost always use a <em>circumvention tool </em>to get to the information you need. Note: Circumvention tools that promise privacy or security are not always private or secure. And tools that use terms like “anonymizer” do not always keeps your identity completely secret.</p>
<p>The circumvention tool that is best for you depends on your <a href="../glossary/threat-model.html" class="glossify-link" title="A way of narrowly thinking about the sorts of protection you want for your data. It's impossible to protect against every kind of trick or attacker, so you should concentrate on which people might want your data, what they might want from it, and how they might get it. Coming up with a set of possible attacks you plan to protect against is called threat modeling. Once you have a threat model, you can conduct a risk analysis.

<p>In this article, we'll talk about four ways to circumvent censorship:</p>
<ul><li>Visiting a web proxy to access a blocked website.</li>
<li>Visiting an encrypted web proxy to access a blocked website.</li>
<li>Using a Virtual Private Network (<a href="../glossary/vpn.html" class="glossify-link" title="A virtual private network is a method for connecting your computer securely to the network of an organization on the other side of the Internet. When you use a VPN, all of your computer's Internet communications is packaged together, encrypted and then relayed to this other organization, where it is decrypted, unpacked, and then sent on to its destination. To the organization's network, or any other computer on the wider Internet, it looks like your computer's request is coming from inside the organization, not from your location. VPNs are used by businesses to provide secure access to internal resources (like file servers or printers). They are also used by individuals to bypass local censorship, or defeat local surveillance. ">VPN<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a>) to access blocked websites or services.</li>
<li>Using the Tor Browser to access a blocked website or protect your identity.</li>
</ul></div><div class="field-item odd"><a name="1"></a> <h2>Basic techniques <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#1">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>Circumvention tools usually work by diverting your web traffic so it avoids the machines that do the blocking or filtering. A service that redirects your Internet connection past these blocks is sometimes called a proxy.</p>
<p><a href="../glossary/https.html" class="glossify-link" title="If you've ever seen a web address spelled out as “http://www.example.com/”, you'll recognize the “http” bit of this term. HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol) is the way a web browser on your machine talks to a remote web server. Unfortunately, standard http sends text insecurely across the Internet. HTTPS (the S stands for “secure”) uses encryption to better protect the data you send to websites, and the information they return to you, from prying eyes. ">HTTPS<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a> is the secure version of the HTTP <a href="../glossary/protocol.html" class="glossify-link" title="A communications protocol is a way of sending data between programs or computers. Software programs that use the same protocol can talk to each other: so web browsers and web servers speak the same protocol, called &quot;http&quot;. Some protocols use encryption to protect their contents. The secure version of the http protocol is called &quot;https&quot;. Another example of an encrypted protocol used by many different programs is OTR (Off-the-Record), a protocol for secure instant messaging. ">protocol<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a> you use to access websites. Sometimes a censor will only block the insecure (HTTP) version of a site. That means you can access the blocked site simply by entering the version of the web address that starts with HTTPS.</p>
<p>This is useful if the censorship you are fighting blocks individual web pages based on their contents. HTTPS stops censors from reading your web traffic, so they cannot tell what keywords are being sent, or which individual web page you are visiting.</p>
<p class="warning">Censors <em>can</em> still see the domain names of all websites you visit. So, for example, if you visit “eff.org/https-everywhere” censors can see that you are on “eff.org” but not that you are on the “https-everywhere” page.</p>
<p>If you suspect this type of simple blocking, try entering https:// before the domain in place of http:</p>
<p class="tip">Try installing EFF’s <a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere">HTTPS Everywhere</a> extension to automatically turn on HTTPS where possible.</p>
<p>Another way that you may be able to circumvent basic censorship techniques is by trying an alternate <a href="../glossary/domain-name.html" class="glossify-link" title="The address, in words, of a website or Internet service; for example: ssd.eff.org ">domain name<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a> or URL. For example, instead of visiting <a href="http://twitter.com/" rel="noreferrer">http://twitter.com</a>, you might try the mobile version of the site at <a href="http://m.twitter.com/" rel="noreferrer">http://m.twitter.com</a>. Censors that block websites or web pages work from a blacklist of banned websites, so anything that is not on that blacklist will get through. They might not know of all different versions of a particular website's name—especially if the administrators of the site know it is blocked and register more than one domain.</p>
</div><div class="field-item even"><a name="2"></a> <h2>Web-based proxies <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#2">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>A <a href="../glossary/web-based-proxy.html" class="glossify-link" title="A website that lets its users access other, blocked or censored websites. Generally, the web proxy will let you type a web address (or URL) onto a web page, and then redisplay that web address on the proxy page. Easier to use than most other censorship-circumventing services. ">web-based proxy<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a> (such as <a href="http://proxy.org/" rel="noreferrer">http://proxy.org/</a>) is a website that lets its users access other blocked or censored websites. It is therefore a good way to circumvent censorship. In order to use a web-based proxy, visit the proxy and enter the web address that you want to see; the proxy will then display the web page you asked for.</p>
<p>However, web-based proxies don’t provide any security and will be a poor choice if your <a href="../glossary/threat-model.html" class="glossify-link" title="A way of narrowly thinking about the sorts of protection you want for your data. It's impossible to protect against every kind of trick or attacker, so you should concentrate on which people might want your data, what they might want from it, and how they might get it.

">threat model<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a> includes someone monitoring your internet connection. They will not help you to use blocked services such as your instant messaging apps. The web-based proxy will have a complete record of everything you do online, which can be a privacy risk for some users depending on their threat model.</p>
</div><div class="field-item odd"><a name="3"></a> <h2>Encrypted proxies <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#3">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>Numerous proxy tools utilize <a href="../glossary/encryption.html" class="glossify-link" title="A process that takes a message and makes it unreadable except to a person who knows how to &quot;decrypt&quot; it back into a readable form. ">encryption<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a> to provide an additional layer of security on top of the ability to bypass filtering. The connection is encrypted so others cannot see what you are visiting. While encrypted proxies are generally more secure than plain web-based proxies, the tool provider may have information about you. They might have your name and email address in their records, for instance. That means that these tools do not provide full anonymity.</p>
<p>The simplest form of an encrypted web proxy is one that starts with “<a href="../glossary/https.html">https</a>”— this will use the encryption usually provided by secure websites. However, be cautious—the owners of these proxies can see the data you send to and from other secure websites. Ultrasurf and Psiphon are examples of these tools.</p>

">VoIP<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a>, and any other Internet service. A VPN protects your traffic from being spied on locally, but your VPN provider can still keep logs of the websites you access, or even let a third party snoop directly on your web browsing. Depending on your <a href="../glossary/threat-model.html" class="glossify-link" title="A way of narrowly thinking about the sorts of protection you want for your data.

">threat model<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a>, the possibility of a government listening in on your VPN connection or getting hold of VPN logs may be a significant risk.

Facebook, Google+, and Twitter have hundreds of millions of users each.</p>
<p>Social networks are often built on the idea of sharing posts, photographs, and personal information. Yet they have also become forums for organizing and speech—much of which relies on privacy and pseudonymity. Thus, the following questions are important to consider when using social networks: How can I interact with these sites while protecting myself? My basic privacy? My identity? My contacts and associations? What information do I want keep private and who do I want to keep it private from?</p>
<p>Depending on your circumstances, you may need to protect yourself against the social media site itself, against other users of the site, or both.</p>
<p>Here are some tips to keep in mind when you’re setting up your account:</p>
</div><div class="field-item odd"><a name="1"></a> <h2>Registering for a Social Media Site <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#1">Anchor link</a></h2>
<ul><li>Do you want to use your real name? Some social media sites have so-called "real name policies," but these have become more lax over time. If you do not want to use your real name when registering for a social media site, do not.</li>
<li>When you register, don't provide more information than is necessary. If you are concerned with hiding your identity, <em>use a separate email address</em>.

For example: “What city were you born in?” or “What is the name of your pet?” You may want to choose password recovery answers that are false. One good way to remember the answers to password recovery questions, should you choose to use false answers for added security, is to note your chosen answers in a <a href="../module/how-use-keepassx.html#overlay=en/node/52/" target="_blank">password safe</a>.</li>
</ul></div><div class="field-item even"><a name="2"></a> <h2>Check the Social Media Site's Privacy Policy <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#2">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>Remember that information stored by third parties is subject to their own policies and may be used for commercial purposes or shared with other companies, for example, marketing firms. We know that reading privacy policies is a near-impossible task, but you may want to take a look at sections on how your data is used, when it is shared with other parties, and how the service responds to law enforcement requests.</p>
<p>Social networking sites, usually for-profit businesses, often collect sensitive information beyond what you explicitly input—where you are, what interests and advertisements you react to, what other sites you've visited (e.g. through "Like" buttons). It can be helpful to block third-party <a href="../glossary/cookies.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="cookies" title="Cookies are a web technology that let websites recognize your browser. Cookies were originally designed to allow sites to offer online shopping carts, save preferences or keep you logged on to a site.

<p>Some social networking sites, like Facebook and Twitter, have business relationships with data brokers in order to target advertisements more effectively. EFF has guides that walk you through how to opt-out of these tracking schemes:</p>

</ul></div><div class="field-item odd"><a name="3"></a> <h2>Change Your Privacy Settings <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#3">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>Specifically, change the default settings. For example, do you want to share your posts with the public, or only with a specific group of people? Should people be able to find you using your email address or phone number? Do you want your location shared automatically?</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/01/how-protect-your-privacy-facebooks-graph-search" target="_blank">How to change your Facebook privacy settings</a></li>
</ul><p>Remember, privacy settings are subject to change. Sometimes, these privacy settings get stronger and more granular; sometimes not. Be sure to pay attention to these changes closely to see if any information that was once private will be shared, or if any additional settings will allow you to take more control of your privacy.</p>
</div><div class="field-item even"><a name="4"></a> <h2>Your Social Graph <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#4">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>Remember that you’re not the only person who can give away potentially sensitive data about yourself<strong>. </strong>Your friends can tag you in photos, report your location, and make their connections to you public in a variety of ways. You may have the option of untagging yourself from these posts, but privacy does not work retroactively. You may want to talk to your friends about what you do and do not feel comfortable having them share about you in public.</p>
