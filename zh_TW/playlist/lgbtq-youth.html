">encryption<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/themes/ssd/img/info.png" /></a> software will generally make it harder for others to read your communications or go through your computer's files. But attacks on your digital security will always seek out the weakest element of your security practices. When you use a new secure tool, you should think about how using it might affect other ways someone could target you. For example, if you decide to use a secure texting program to talk to a contact because you know that your phone might be compromised, might the fact that you're using this program at all give an <a href="../glossary/adversary.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="adversary" title="Your adversary is the person or organization attempting to undermine your security goals.

Often the adversary is hypothetical. ">adversary<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/themes/ssd/img/info.png" /></a> a clue that you are talking about private information?</p>
<p>Secondly, remember your <a href="../glossary/threat-model.html">threat model</a>. You don't need to buy some expensive encrypted phone system that claims to be “NSA-proof” if your biggest <a href="../glossary/threat.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="threat" title="In computer security, a threat is a potential event that could undermine your efforts to defend your data.

">threat<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/themes/ssd/img/info.png" /></a> is physical surveillance from a private investigator with no access to internet surveillance tools. Alternatively, if you are facing a government that regularly jails dissidents <em>because</em> they use encryption tools, it may make sense to use simpler tricks—like a set of pre-arranged codes—rather than risk leaving evidence that you use encryption software on your laptop.</p>
<p>Given all that, here are some questions you can ask about a tool before downloading, purchasing, or using it.</p>
</div><div class="field-item even"><a name="2"></a> <h2><a id="Transparent" name="Transparent"></a>How Transparent is it? <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#2">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>Even though digital security seems to be mostly about keeping secrets, there's a strong belief among security researchers that openness and transparency leads to more secure tools.</p>
<p>Much of the software used and recommended by the digital security community is open source, which is to say that the code that defines how it works is publicly available for others to examine, modify, and share. By being transparent about how their program works, the creators of these tools invite others to look for security flaws, and help improve the program.</p>
<p>Open software provides the opportunity for better security but does not guarantee it. The open source advantage relies in part on a community of technologists actually checking the code, which for small projects (and even for popular, complex ones) may be hard to achieve. When you're considering using a tool, see if its source code is available, and whether the code has an independent security audit to confirm the quality of its security. At the very least, software or hardware should have a detailed technical explanation of how it functions, for other experts to inspect.</p>
</div><div class="field-item odd"><a name="3"></a> <h2><a id="Clarity" name="Clarity"></a>How Clear are its Creators About its Advantages and Disadvantages? <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#3">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>No software or hardware is entirely secure. Creators or sellers who are honest about the limitations of their product will give you a much stronger idea of whether their application is appropriate for you.</p>
<p class="warning">Don't trust blanket statements that say that the code is “military-grade” or “NSA-proof”; these mean nothing and give a strong warning that the creators are overconfident or unwilling to consider the possible failings in their product.</p>
<p>Because attackers are always trying to discover new ways to break the security of tools, software and hardware often needs to be updated to fix new vulnerabilities. It can be a serious problem if the creators of a tool are unwilling to do this, either because they fear bad publicity, or because they have not built the infrastructure to fix problems.</p>
<p>You can't predict the future, but a good indicator of how toolmakers will behave in the future is their past activity. If the tool's website lists previous issues and links to regular updates and information—like specifically how long it has been since the software was last updated—you can be more confident that they will continue to provide this service in the future.</p>
</div><div class="field-item even"><a name="4"></a> <h2><a id="Compromised" name="Compromised"></a>What Happens if the Creators are Compromised? <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#4">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>When security toolmakers build software and hardware, they (just like you) must have a clear <a href="../glossary/threat-model.html">threat model</a>. The best creators will explicitly describe what kind of attackers they can protect you from in their documentation.</p>
<p>But there's one attacker that many manufacturers do not want to think about: what if they, themselves, are compromised or decide to <a href="../glossary/attack.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="attack" title="In computer security, an attack is a method that can be used to compromise security, or its actual use. An attacker is the person or organization using an attack. An attack method is sometimes called an &quot;exploit.&quot; " data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" data-html="true" data-toggle="popover" data-container="body" data-content="In computer security, an attack is a method that can be used to compromise security, or its actual use. An attacker is the person or organization using an attack. An attack method is sometimes called an &quot;exploit.&quot; ">attack<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/themes/ssd/img/info.png" /></a> their own users. For instance, a court or government may compel a company to give up personal data or create a “backdoor” that will remove all the protections their tool offers. You may want to consider the jurisdiction(s) where the creators are based. If your <a href="../glossary/threat.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="threat" title="In computer security, a threat is a potential event that could undermine your efforts to defend your data. Threats can be intentional (conceived by attackers), or they could be accidental (you might leave your computer turned on and unguarded).

">threat<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/themes/ssd/img/info.png" /></a> is from the government of Iran, for example, a US-based company will be able to resist Iranian court orders, even if it must comply with US orders.</p>
<p>Even if a creator is able to resist government pressure, an attacker may attempt to achieve the same result by breaking into the toolmakers' own systems in order to attack its customers.</p>
<p>The most resilient tools are those that consider this as a possible attack, and are designed to defend against this. Look for language that asserts that a creator cannot access private data, rather than promises that a creator <em>will</em> not. Look for institutions with a <a href="https://www.eff.org/who-has-your-back-government-data-requests-2014" target="_blank">reputation for fighting court orders for personal data</a>.</p>
</div><div class="field-item odd"><a name="5"></a> <h2><a id="Recalls" name="Recalls"></a>Check for Recalls and Online Criticism <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#5">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>Of course, companies selling products and enthusiasts advertising their latest software can be misled, be misleading, or even outright lie. A product that was originally secure might be discovered to have terrible flaws in the future. Make sure you stay well-informed on the latest news about the tools that you use.</p>
</div><div class="field-item even"><a name="6"></a> <h2><a id="Sametool" name="Sametool"></a>Do you Know Others who Use the Same Tool? <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#6">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>It's a lot of work for one person to keep up with the latest news about a tool. If you have colleagues who use a particular product or service, work with them to stay informed about what's happening.</p>
</div><div class="field-item odd"><a name="7"></a> <h2><a id="Products" name="Products"></a>Products Mentioned in This Guide <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#7">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>We try to ensure that the software and hardware we mention in this guide complies with the criteria we've listed above: we have made a good faith effort to only list products that have a solid grounding in what we currently know about digital security, are generally transparent about their operation (and their failings), have defenses against the possibility that the creators themselves will be compromised, and are currently maintained, with a large and technically-knowledgeable user base. We believe that they have, at the time of writing, the eye of a wide audience who is examining them for flaws, and would raise concerns to the public quickly. Please understand that we do not have the resources to examine or make independent assurances about their security, we are not endorsing these products and cannot guarantee complete security.</p>
</div><div class="field-item even"><a name="8"></a> <h2><a id="Which_device" name="Which_device"></a>Which Phone Should I Buy? Which Computer? <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#8">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>One of the most frequent questions asked of security trainers is “Should I buy Android or an iPhone?” or “Should I use a PC or a Mac?” or “What <a href="../glossary/operating-system.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="operating system" title="A program that runs all the other programs on a computer. Windows, Android and Apple's OS X and iOS are all examples of operating systems.

Windows, Android and Apple's OS X and iOS are all examples of operating systems. ">operating system<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/themes/ssd/img/info.png" /></a> should I use?” There are no simple answers to these questions. The relative safety of software and devices is constantly shifting as new flaws are discovered and old bugs are fixed. Companies may compete with each other to provide you with better security, or they may all be under pressure from governments to weaken that security.</p>
<p>Some general advice is almost always true, however. When you buy a device or an operating system, keep current with its software updates. Updates will often fix security problems in older code that attacks can exploit. Older phones and operating systems are no longer supported, even for security updates. In particular, Microsoft has made it clear that Windows XP and earlier Windows versions will not receive fixes for even severe security problems. If you use XP, you cannot expect it to be secure from attackers. (The same is true for OS X before 10.7.5 or "Lion").</p>

Facebook, Google+, and Twitter have hundreds of millions of users each.</p>
<p>Social networks are often built on the idea of sharing posts, photographs, and personal information. Yet they have also become forums for organizing and speech—much of which relies on privacy and pseudonymity. Thus, the following questions are important to consider when using social networks: How can I interact with these sites while protecting myself? My basic privacy? My identity? My contacts and associations? What information do I want keep private and who do I want to keep it private from?</p>
<p>Depending on your circumstances, you may need to protect yourself against the social media site itself, against other users of the site, or both.</p>

<p>Social networking sites, usually for-profit businesses, often collect sensitive information beyond what you explicitly input—where you are, what interests and advertisements you react to, what other sites you've visited (e.g. through "Like" buttons).

It begins with understanding the unique threats you face and how you can counter those threats.</p>
<p>In computer security, a <a href="../glossary/threat.html" class="glossify-link" title="In computer security, a threat is a potential event that could undermine your efforts to defend your data.

<p>This guide will teach you how to <a href="../glossary/threat-model.html" class="glossify-link" title="A way of narrowly thinking about the sorts of protection you want for your data. It's impossible to protect against every kind of trick or attacker, so you should concentrate on which people might want your data, what they might want from it, and how they might get it.

<p>What might threat modeling look like? Let’s say you want to keep your house and possessions safe, here are a few questions you might ask:</p>
<p><strong><em>What do I have inside my home that is worth protecting?</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>Assets could include: jewelry, electronics, financial documents, passports, or photos</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>Who do I want to protect it from?</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>Adversaries could include: burglars, roommates, or guests</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>How likely is it that I will need to protect it?</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>Does my neighborhood have a history of burglaries? How trustworthy are my roommates/guests? What are the capabilities of my adversaries? What are the risks I should consider?</li>
</ul><p><em><strong>How bad are the consequences if I fail?</strong></em></p>
<ul><li>Do I have anything in my house that I cannot replace? Do I have the time or money to replace these things? Do I have insurance that covers goods stolen from my home?</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>How much trouble am I willing to go through to prevent these consequences?</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>Am I willing to buy a safe for sensitive documents? Can I afford to buy a high-quality lock? Do I have time to open a security box at my local bank and keep my valuables there?</li>
</ul><p>Once you have asked yourself these questions, you are in a position to assess what measures to take. If your possessions are valuable, but the risk of a break-in is low, then you may not want to invest too much money in a lock. But, if the risk is high, you’ll want to get the best lock on the market, and consider adding a security system.</p>
<p>Building a threat model helps you to understand the unique threats you face, your assets, your <a href="../glossary/adversary.html" class="glossify-link" title="Your adversary is the person or organization attempting to undermine your security goals.

<p>An “<a href="../glossary/asset.html" class="glossify-link" title="In threat modeling, any piece of data or a device that needs to be protected. ">asset<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a>” is something you value and want to protect. In the context of digital security, an asset is usually some kind of information. For example, your emails, contact lists, instant messages, location, and files are all possible assets. Your devices may also be assets.</p>
<p><em>Make a list of your assets: data that you keep, where it’s kept, who has access to it, and what stops others from accessing it.</em></p>
<h3>Who do I want to protect it from?</h3>
<p>To answer this question, it’s important to identify who might want to target you or your information. A person or entity that poses a threat to your assets is an “<a href="../glossary/adversary.html" class="glossify-link" title="Your adversary is the person or organization attempting to undermine your security goals. Adversaries can be different, depending on the situation. For instance, you may worry about criminals spying on the network at a cafe, or your classmates at a school. Often the adversary is hypothetical. ">adversary<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a>.” Examples of potential adversaries are your boss, your former partner, your business competition, your government, or a hacker on a public network.</p>
<p><em>Make a list of your adversaries, or those who might want to get ahold of your assets. Your list may include individuals, a government agency, or corporations.</em></p>
<p class="warning">Depending on who your adversaries are, under some circumstances this list might be something you want to destroy after you’re done threat modeling.</p>
<h3>How bad are the consequences if I fail?</h3>
<p>There are many ways that an adversary can threaten your data. For example, an adversary can read your private communications as they pass through the network, or they can delete or corrupt your data.</p>
<p>The motives of adversaries differ widely, as do their attacks. A government trying to prevent the spread of a video showing police violence may be content to simply delete or reduce the availability of that video. In contrast, a political opponent may wish to gain access to secret content and publish that content without you knowing.</p>
<p>Threat modeling involves understanding how bad the consequences could be if an adversary successfully attacks one of your assets. To determine this, you should consider the <a href="../glossary/capability.html" class="glossify-link" title="The capability of an attacker (in the sense we use it in this guide) is what it is able to do to achieve its aims. For example, a country's security services might have the capability to listen to telephone calls while a neighbor may have the capability to watch you from their window. To say that an attacker “has&quot; a capability does not mean that they will necessarily use that capability. It does mean that you should consider and prepare for the possibility. ">capability<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a> of your adversary. For example, your mobile phone provider has access to all your phone records and thus has the capability to use that data against you. A hacker on an open Wi-Fi network can access your unencrypted communications. Your government might have stronger capabilities.</p>
<p><em>Write down what your adversary might want to do with your private data.</em></p>
<h3>How likely is it that I will need to protect it?</h3>
<p>Risk is the likelihood that a particular threat against a particular asset will actually occur. It goes hand-in-hand with capability. While your mobile phone provider has the capability to access all of your data, the risk of them posting your private data online to harm your reputation is low.</p>
<p>It is important to distinguish between threats and risks. While a threat is a bad thing that can happen, risk is the likelihood that the threat will occur. For instance, there is a threat that your building might collapse, but the risk of this happening is far greater in San Francisco (where earthquakes are common) than in Stockholm (where they are not).</p>
<p>Conducting a <a href="../glossary/risk-analysis.html" class="glossify-link" title="In computer security, risk analysis is calculating the chance that threats might succeed, so you know how much effort to spend defending against them. There may be many different ways that you might lose control or access to your data, but some of them are less likely than others. Assessing risk means deciding which threats you are going to take seriously, and which may be too rare or too harmless (or too difficult to combat) to worry about. See threat modeling. ">risk analysis<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a> is both a personal and a subjective process; not everyone has the same priorities or views threats in the same way. Many people find certain threats unacceptable no matter what the risk, because the mere presence of the threat at any likelihood is not worth the cost. In other cases, people disregard high risks because they don't view the threat as a problem.</p>
<p><em>Write down which threats you are going to take seriously, and which may be too rare or too harmless (or too difficult to combat) to worry about.</em></p>
<h3>How much trouble am I willing to go through to try to prevent potential consequences?</h3>
<p>Answering this question requires conducting the risk analysis. Not everyone has the same priorities or views threats in the same way.</p>
<p>For example, an attorney representing a client in a national security case would probably be willing to go to greater lengths to protect communications about that case, such as using encrypted email, than a mother who regularly emails her daughter funny cat videos.</p>
<p><em>Write down what options you have available to you to help mitigate your unique threats. Note if you have any financial constraints, technical constraints, or social constraints.</em></p>

<p>Keep in mind your <a href="../glossary/threat-model.html" class="glossify-link" title="A way of narrowly thinking about the sorts of protection you want for your data. It's impossible to protect against every kind of trick or attacker, so you should concentrate on which people might want your data, what they might want from it, and how they might get it.

Thus, conducting frequent threat modeling assessments is good practice.</p>
<p class="tip">Create your own threat model based on your own unique situation. Then mark your calendar for a date in the future. This will prompt you to review your threat model and check back in to assess whether it’s still relevant to your situation.</p>

<p>Some webmail providers that use HTTPS by default include:</p>
<ul><li>Gmail</li>
<li>Riseup</li>
<li>Yahoo</li>
</ul><p>Some webmail providers that give you the option of choosing to use HTTPS by default by selecting it in your settings. The most popular service that still does this is Hotmail.</p>
<p>What does transport-layer encryption do and why might you need it? HTTPS, also referred to as SSL or TLS, encrypts your communications so that it cannot be read by other people on your network. This can include the other people using the same Wi-Fi in an airport or at a café, the other people at your office or school, the administrators at your ISP, malicious hackers, governments, or law enforcement officials. Communications sent over your web browser, including the web pages that you visit and the content of your emails, blog posts, and messages, using HTTP rather than HTTPS are trivial for an attacker to intercept and read.</p>
<p>HTTPS is the most basic level of encryption for your web browsing that we recommend for everybody. It is as basic as putting on your seat belt when you drive.</p>
<p>But there are some things that HTTPS does not do. When you send email using HTTPS, your email provider still gets an unencrypted copy of your communication. Governments and law enforcement may be able to access this data with a warrant. In the United States, most email providers have a policy that says they will tell you when you have received a government request for your user data as long as they are legally allowed to do so, but these policies are strictly voluntary, and in many cases providers are legally prevented from informing their users of requests for data. Some email providers, such as Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft, publish transparency reports, detailing the number of government requests for user data they receive, which countries make the requests, and how often the company has complied by turning over data.</p>

Together, these words form your “passphrase.” A "passphrase" is a type of password that is longer for added security. For disk encryption and your password manager, we recommend selecting a minimum of six words.</p>
<p><em>Why use a minimum of six words? Why use dice to pick words in a phrase randomly?</em> The longer and more random the password, the harder it is for both computers and humans to guess.

<p>Beware of the “security questions” that websites use to confirm your identity.

<p>Instead, give fictional answers that no one knows but you.

So the next time your bank asks you your mother's maiden name, you should be ready to answer &quot;Correct Battery Horse Staple&quot; or similar. ">security question<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a> asks:</p>

<p class="tip">Think of sites where you’ve used security questions and consider changing your responses. Do not use the same passwords or security question answers for multiple accounts on different websites or services.</p>

To further protect your accounts, enable <a href="../glossary/two-factor-authentication.html" class="glossify-link" title="&quot;Something you know, and something you have.&quot; Login systems that require only a username and password risk being broken when someone else can obtain (or guess) those pieces of information. Services that offer two-factor authentication also require you to provide a separate confirmation that you are who you say you are. The second factor could be a one-off secret code, a number generated by a program running on a mobile device, or a device that you carry and that you can use to confirm who you are. Companies like banks, and major internet services like Google, Paypal and Twitter now offer two-factor authentication. ">two-factor authentication<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a>.</p>
<p>Some services offer two-factor authentication (also called 2FA, multi-factor authentication, or two-step verification), which requires users to possess two components (a <a href="../glossary/password.html" class="glossify-link" title="A secret meant to be memorized, and meant to limit access to something so that only someone who knows the password can gain access. It might limit access to an online account, a device, or something else. A long password based on multiple words may also be called a &quot;passphrase&quot; to remind us that it's not just one &quot;word.&quot; A main password to unlock other passwords in a password manager or password safe application is often called a &quot;master password.” ">password<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a> and a second factor) to gain access to their account. The second factor could be a one-off secret code or a number generated by a program running on a mobile device.</p>
<p>Two-factor authentication using a mobile phone can be done in one of two ways:</p>
<ul><li>your phone can run an authenticator application that generates security codes (such as <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en" rel="noreferrer">Google Authenticator</a> or <a href="https://authy.com/" rel="noreferrer">Authy</a>) or you can use a stand-alone hardware device (such as a YubiKey); or</li>
<li>the service can send you an SMS text message with an extra security code that you need to type in whenever you log in.</li>
</ul><p class="tip">If you have a choice, pick the authenticator application or stand-alone hardware device instead of receiving codes by text message. It’s easier for an attacker to redirect these codes to their own phone than it is to bypass the authenticator.</p>
<p>Some services, such as Google, also allow you to generate a list of one-time passwords, also called single-use passwords. These are meant to be printed or written down on paper and carried with you. Each of these passwords works only once, so if one is stolen by spyware when you enter it, the thief won't be able to use it for anything in the future.</p>
<p class="tip">If you or your organization run your own communications infrastructure, there's free software available that can be used to enable two-factor authentication for accessing your systems. Look for software offering implementations of the open standard “Time-Based One-Time Passwords” or <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238" rel="noreferrer">RFC 6238</a>.</p>

<p>Governments, companies, schools, and Internet providers sometimes use software to prevent their users from accessing certain websites and services. This is called <a href="../glossary/internet-filtering.html" class="glossify-link" title="Filtering is the politer term for blocking or censoring Internet traffic. ">Internet filtering<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a> or blocking, and it is a form of censorship. Filtering comes in different forms. Censors can block individual web pages, or even entire websites. Sometimes, content is blocked based on the keywords it contains.</p>
<p>There are different ways of beating Internet censorship. Some protect you from surveillance, but many do not. When someone who controls your net connection filters or blocks a site, you can almost always use a <em>circumvention tool </em>to get to the information you need. Note: Circumvention tools that promise privacy or security are not always private or secure. And tools that use terms like “anonymizer” do not always keeps your identity completely secret.</p>
<p>The circumvention tool that is best for you depends on your <a href="../glossary/threat-model.html" class="glossify-link" title="A way of narrowly thinking about the sorts of protection you want for your data. It's impossible to protect against every kind of trick or attacker, so you should concentrate on which people might want your data, what they might want from it, and how they might get it. Coming up with a set of possible attacks you plan to protect against is called threat modeling. Once you have a threat model, you can conduct a risk analysis. ">threat model<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a>. If you’re not sure what your threat model is, start <a href="../node/39.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>In this article, we'll talk about four ways to circumvent censorship:</p>
<ul><li>Visiting a web proxy to access a blocked website.</li>
<li>Visiting an encrypted web proxy to access a blocked website.</li>
<li>Using a Virtual Private Network (<a href="../glossary/vpn.html" class="glossify-link" title="A virtual private network is a method for connecting your computer securely to the network of an organization on the other side of the Internet. When you use a VPN, all of your computer's Internet communications is packaged together, encrypted and then relayed to this other organization, where it is decrypted, unpacked, and then sent on to its destination. To the organization's network, or any other computer on the wider Internet, it looks like your computer's request is coming from inside the organization, not from your location. VPNs are used by businesses to provide secure access to internal resources (like file servers or printers). They are also used by individuals to bypass local censorship, or defeat local surveillance. ">VPN<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a>) to access blocked websites or services.</li>
<li>Using the Tor Browser to access a blocked website or protect your identity.</li>
</ul></div><div class="field-item odd"><a name="1"></a> <h2>Basic techniques <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#1">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>Circumvention tools usually work by diverting your web traffic so it avoids the machines that do the blocking or filtering. A service that redirects your Internet connection past these blocks is sometimes called a proxy.</p>
<p><a href="../glossary/https.html" class="glossify-link" title="If you've ever seen a web address spelled out as “http://www.example.com/”, you'll recognize the “http” bit of this term. HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol) is the way a web browser on your machine talks to a remote web server. Unfortunately, standard http sends text insecurely across the Internet. HTTPS (the S stands for “secure”) uses encryption to better protect the data you send to websites, and the information they return to you, from prying eyes. ">HTTPS<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a> is the secure version of the HTTP <a href="../glossary/protocol.html" class="glossify-link" title="A communications protocol is a way of sending data between programs or computers. Software programs that use the same protocol can talk to each other: so web browsers and web servers speak the same protocol, called &quot;http&quot;. Some protocols use encryption to protect their contents. The secure version of the http protocol is called &quot;https&quot;. Another example of an encrypted protocol used by many different programs is OTR (Off-the-Record), a protocol for secure instant messaging. ">protocol<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a> you use to access websites. Sometimes a censor will only block the insecure (HTTP) version of a site. That means you can access the blocked site simply by entering the version of the web address that starts with HTTPS.</p>
<p>This is useful if the censorship you are fighting blocks individual web pages based on their contents. HTTPS stops censors from reading your web traffic, so they cannot tell what keywords are being sent, or which individual web page you are visiting.</p>
<p class="warning">Censors <em>can</em> still see the domain names of all websites you visit. So, for example, if you visit “eff.org/https-everywhere” censors can see that you are on “eff.org” but not that you are on the “https-everywhere” page.</p>
<p>If you suspect this type of simple blocking, try entering https:// before the domain in place of http:</p>
<p class="tip">Try installing EFF’s <a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere">HTTPS Everywhere</a> extension to automatically turn on HTTPS where possible.</p>
<p>Another way that you may be able to circumvent basic censorship techniques is by trying an alternate <a href="../glossary/domain-name.html" class="glossify-link" title="The address, in words, of a website or Internet service; for example: ssd.eff.org ">domain name<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a> or URL. For example, instead of visiting <a href="http://twitter.com/" rel="noreferrer">http://twitter.com</a>, you might try the mobile version of the site at <a href="http://m.twitter.com/" rel="noreferrer">http://m.twitter.com</a>. Censors that block websites or web pages work from a blacklist of banned websites, so anything that is not on that blacklist will get through. They might not know of all different versions of a particular website's name—especially if the administrators of the site know it is blocked and register more than one domain.</p>
</div><div class="field-item even"><a name="2"></a> <h2>Web-based proxies <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#2">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>A <a href="../glossary/web-based-proxy.html" class="glossify-link" title="A website that lets its users access other, blocked or censored websites. Generally, the web proxy will let you type a web address (or URL) onto a web page, and then redisplay that web address on the proxy page. Easier to use than most other censorship-circumventing services. ">web-based proxy<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a> (such as <a href="http://proxy.org/" rel="noreferrer">http://proxy.org/</a>) is a website that lets its users access other blocked or censored websites. It is therefore a good way to circumvent censorship. In order to use a web-based proxy, visit the proxy and enter the web address that you want to see; the proxy will then display the web page you asked for.</p>
<p>However, web-based proxies don’t provide any security and will be a poor choice if your <a href="../glossary/threat-model.html" class="glossify-link" title="A way of narrowly thinking about the sorts of protection you want for your data. It's impossible to protect against every kind of trick or attacker, so you should concentrate on which people might want your data, what they might want from it, and how they might get it. Coming up with a set of possible attacks you plan to protect against is called threat modeling. Once you have a threat model, you can conduct a risk analysis. ">threat model<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a> includes someone monitoring your internet connection. They will not help you to use blocked services such as your instant messaging apps. The web-based proxy will have a complete record of everything you do online, which can be a privacy risk for some users depending on their threat model.</p>
</div><div class="field-item odd"><a name="3"></a> <h2>Encrypted proxies <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#3">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>Numerous proxy tools utilize <a href="../glossary/encryption.html" class="glossify-link" title="A process that takes a message and makes it unreadable except to a person who knows how to &quot;decrypt&quot; it back into a readable form. ">encryption<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a> to provide an additional layer of security on top of the ability to bypass filtering. The connection is encrypted so others cannot see what you are visiting. While encrypted proxies are generally more secure than plain web-based proxies, the tool provider may have information about you. They might have your name and email address in their records, for instance. That means that these tools do not provide full anonymity.</p>
<p>The simplest form of an encrypted web proxy is one that starts with “<a href="../glossary/https.html">https</a>”— this will use the encryption usually provided by secure websites. However, be cautious—the owners of these proxies can see the data you send to and from other secure websites. Ultrasurf and Psiphon are examples of these tools.</p>
</div><div class="field-item even"><a name="4"></a> <h2>Virtual Private Networks <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#4">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>A Virtual Private Network (<a href="../glossary/vpn.html" class="glossify-link" title="A virtual private network is a method for connecting your computer securely to the network of an organization on the other side of the Internet.

">VPN<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a>) encrypts and sends all Internet data from your computer through another computer. This computer could belong to a commercial or nonprofit VPN service, your company, or a trusted contact. Once a VPN service is correctly configured, you can use it to access webpages, e-mail, instant messaging, <a href="../glossary/voip.html" class="glossify-link" title="Any technology that allows you to use the Internet for voice communication with other VoIP users or receive telephone calls over the Internet. ">VoIP<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a>, and any other Internet service. A VPN protects your traffic from being spied on locally, but your VPN provider can still keep logs of the websites you access, or even let a third party snoop directly on your web browsing. Depending on your <a href="../glossary/threat-model.html" class="glossify-link" title="A way of narrowly thinking about the sorts of protection you want for your data.

">threat model<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a>, the possibility of a government listening in on your VPN connection or getting hold of VPN logs may be a significant risk. For some users, this could outweigh the short-term benefits of using a VPN.</p>

While Apple encrypts most data in its backups, it may be possible for the company to obtain access for law enforcement purposes since Apple also controls the keys used for iCloud <a href="../glossary/encryption.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="encryption" title="A process that takes a message and makes it unreadable except to a person who knows how to &quot;decrypt&quot; it back into a readable form.

</li>
<li>
<p>If you turn on data protection as described above, you will also be able to delete your data on your device securely and quickly. In the Passcode settings, you can set your device to wipe all its data after ten failed attempts to guess your passphrase.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140902203916/http://www.apple.com/legal/more-resources/law-enforcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Apple’s old Law Enforcement Guide</a>, “Apple can extract certain categories of active data from passcode locked iOS devices. Specifically, the user generated active files on an iOS device that are contained in Apple’s native apps and for which the data is not encrypted using the passcode (“user generated active files”), can be extracted and provided to law enforcement on external media. Apple can perform this data extraction process on iOS devices running iOS 4 or more recent versions of iOS. Please note the only categories of user generated active files that can be provided to law enforcement, pursuant to a valid search warrant, are: SMS, photos, videos, contacts, audio recording, and call history. Apple cannot provide: email, calendar entries, or any third-party App data.”</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The above information applies only to iOS devices running versions of iOS prior to 8.0.</p>
<ul><li>Now, <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/government-information-requests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Apple states</a> that "On devices running iOS 8 and later versions, your personal data is placed under the protection of your passcode. For all devices running iOS 8 and later versions, Apple will not perform iOS data extractions in response to government search warrants because the files to be extracted are protected by an <a href="../glossary/encryption-key.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="encryption key" title="An encryption key is a piece of information that is used to convert a message into an unreadable form. In some cases, you need the same encryption key to decode the message. In others, the encryption key and decryption key are different. " data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" data-html="true" data-toggle="popover" data-container="body" data-content="An encryption key is a piece of information that is used to convert a message into an unreadable form.

">encryption key<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/themes/ssd/img/info.png" /></a> that is tied to the user’s passcode, which Apple does not possess."</li>
</ul><p class="warning">REMEMBER: While Apple will be unable to extract data directly off a phone, if the device is set to sync with iCloud, or backup to a computer, much of the same data will indeed be accessible to law enforcement. Under most circumstances, iOS encryption is only effective when a device has been fully powered down (or freshly-rebooted, without being unlocked). Some attackers might be able to take valuable data from your device's memory when it's turned on. (They might even be able to take the data when it has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_boot_attack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">just been turned off</a>). Keep this in mind and, if possible, try to make sure your device is powered off (or rebooted and not unlocked) if you believe it's likely to be seized or stolen.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>If you are concerned about your device getting lost or stolen, you can also set up your Apple device so that it can be erased remotely, using the “Find My iPhone” feature. Note that this will allow Apple to remotely request the location of your device at any time. You should balance the benefit of deleting data if you lose control of your device, with the risk of revealing your own position. (Mobile phones transmit this information to telephone companies as a matter of course; WiFi devices like iPads and the iPod Touch do not.)</p>

<h3>Step 1: Download and Install Signal – Private Messenger</h3>
<p>On your iOS device, enter the App Store and search for “Signal.” Select the app <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/signal-private-messenger/id874139669?mt=8" rel="noreferrer">Signal – Private Messenger</a> by Open Whisper Systems.</p>
<p>Tap "GET" to download the app, then "INSTALL." You may be prompted to enter your Apple ID credentials. Once it has downloaded, click “OPEN” to launch the app.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Register and Verify your Phone Number</h3>
<p>You will now see the following screen. Enter your mobile phone number and tap “Verify This Device.”</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2016/11/30/resized000.png" height="632" width="356" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2016/11/30/resized001.png" height="632" width="356" /></p>
<p>In order to verify your phone number, you will be sent an SMS text with a six-digit code. You will now be prompted to enter that code, and then tap "Submit Verification Code."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2016/11/30/resized002.png" height="632" width="356" /></p>
<p>After this process is complete, Signal will request access to your contacts. Tap "Continue."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2016/11/30/resized003.png" height="632" width="356" /></p>
<p>Signal will then request permission to send you notifications. Tap "OK."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2016/11/30/resized004.png" height="632" width="356" /></p>
</div><div class="field-item odd"><a name="1"></a> <h2>Using Signal <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#1">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>In order to use Signal, the person that you are calling must have Signal installed. If you try to call or send a message to someone using the Signal app and they do not have any of the aforementioned apps installed, the app will ask if you would like to invite them via SMS, but it will not allow you to complete your call or send a message to them from inside the app.</p>
<p class="warning">Signal provides you with a list of other Signal users in your contacts. To do this, data representing the phone numbers in your contact list is uploaded to the Signal servers, although this data is deleted almost immediately.</p>
<a name="1"></a> <h2>How to Send an Encrypted Message <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#1">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p class="warning">Note that Open Whisper Systems, the makers of Signal, use other companies' infrastructure to send its users alerts when they receive a new message. It uses Google on Android, and Apple on iPhone. That means information about who is receiving messages and when they were received may leak to these companies.</p>
<p>To get started, tap the compose icon in the upper-right corner of the screen.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2016/11/30/resized005-compose.png" height="632" width="356" /></p>
<p>You will see a list of all the registered Signal users in your contacts.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2016/11/30/resized008.png" height="632" width="356" /></p>
<p>When you tap a contact, you'll be brought to the text-messaging screen for your contact. From this screen, you can send end-to-end encrypted text, picture, or video messages.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2016/11/30/resized010.png" height="632" width="356" /></p>
<h3>How to Initiate an Encrypted Call</h3>
<p>To initiate an encrypted call to a contact, select that contact and then tap on the phone icon.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2016/11/30/resized010-phone.png" height="632" width="356" /></p>
<p>At this point, Signal may ask for permission to access the microphone. Tap "OK."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2016/11/30/resized011.png" height="632" width="356" /></p>
<p>Once a call is established, your call is encrypted.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-initiate-an-encrypted-video-call">How to Initiate an Encrypted Video Call</h3>
<p>To make an encrypted video call, simply call someone as described above:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2017/02/28/initial_video_screen_0.png" height="632" width="356" /></p>
<p>and tap the video camera icon. You may have to allow Signal to access video from your camera. This shares your video with your friend (your friend may have to do the same):</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2017/02/28/video_0.png" height="632" width="356" /></p>
<h3>How to Start an Encrypted Group Chat</h3>
<p>You can send an encrypted group message by tapping the compose icon in the upper-right corner of the screen (the square with a pencil pointing to the center), and then tapping the icon in the same place with three figures.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2016/11/30/resized005-compose.png" height="632" width="356" /></p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2016/11/30/resized008-group.png" height="632" width="356" /></p>
<p>On the following screen, you'll be able to name the group and add participants to it. After adding participants, you can tap on the "+" icon in the upper right corner of the screen.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2016/11/30/resized023-plus.png" height="632" width="356" /></p>
<p>This will initiate the group chat.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2016/11/30/resized024.png" height="632" width="356" /></p>
<p>If you wish to change the group name, or add or remove participants, this can be done from the group chat screen by tapping the overflow icon (the three dots in the upper-right corner of the screen) and selecting “Edit group.”</p>
<h3>How to Verify your Contacts</h3>
<p>At this point, you can verify the authenticity of the person you are talking with, to ensure that their <a href="../glossary/encryption-key.html">encryption key</a> wasn't tampered with or replaced with the <a href="../glossary/key.html">key</a> of someone else when your application downloaded it (a process called <a href="../glossary/key-verification.html">key verification</a>). Verifying is a process that takes place when you are physically in the presence of the person you are talking with.</p>
<p>First, open the screen where you are able to message your contact, as described above. From this screen, tap the name of your contact at the top of the screen.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2016/11/30/resized010-name.png" height="632" width="356" /></p>
<p>From the following screen, tap "Verify Safety Numbers."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2016/11/30/resized015-verify.png" height="632" width="356" /></p>
<p>You will now be brought to a screen which displays a QR code and a list of 'safety numbers.' This code will be unique for every different contact you are conversing with. Have your contact navigate to the corresponding screen for their conversation with you, so that they have a QR code displayed on their screen as well.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2016/11/30/resized016.png" height="632" width="356" /></p>
<p>Back on your device, tap "Scan Code." At this point, Signal may ask for permission to access the camera. Tap "OK."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2016/11/30/resized017.png" height="632" width="356" /></p>
<p>Now you will be able to use the camera to scan the QR code that is displayed on your contact's screen. Align your camera to the QR code:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2016/11/30/resized018.png" height="632" width="356" /></p>
<p>Hopefully, your camera will scan the barcode and show a "Safety Numbers Verified!" dialogue, like this:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2016/11/30/resized019.png" height="632" width="356" /></p>
<p>This indicates that you have verified your contact successfully. If instead your screen looks like this, something has gone wrong:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2016/11/30/resized020.png" height="632" width="356" /></p>
<p>You may want to avoid discussing sensitive topics until you have verified keys with that person.</p>
<p><em>Note for power users: The screen displaying your QR code also has an icon to share your safety number</em><em> in the top-right corner. In-person verification is the preferred method, but you may have already authenticated your contact using another secure application, such as <a href="../glossary/pgp.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="PGP" title="PGP or Pretty Good Privacy was one of the first popular implementations of public key cryptography. Phil Zimmermann, its creator, wrote the program in 1991 to help activists and others protect their communications. He was formally investigated by the US government when the program spread outside the United States. At the time, exporting tools that included strong public key encryption was a violation of US law. PGP continues to exist as a commercial software product. A free implementation of the same underlying standard that PGP uses called GnuPG (or GPG) is also available. Because both use the same interchangeable approach, people will refer to using a “PGP key” or sending a “PGP message”, even if they are using GnuPG.

">PGP<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/themes/ssd/img/info.png" /></a>. Since you've already verified your contact, you can safely use the trust established in that application to verify </em><em>numbers within Signal, without having to be physically in the presence of your contact. In this case you can share your safety number with that application by tapping the "share" icon, and send your contact your safety number.</em></p>
<h3>Disappearing Messages</h3>
<p>Signal has a feature called “disappearing messages” which ensures that messages will be removed from your device and the device of your contact some chosen amount of time after they are seen. To enable "disappearing messages" for a conversation, open the screen where you are able to message your contact. From this screen, tap the name of the contact at the top of the screen, then tap the slider next to "Disappearing Messages."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2016/11/30/resized015-slider.png" height="632" width="356" /></p>
<p>A slider will appear that allows you to choose how quickly messages will disappear:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2016/11/30/resized021.png" height="632" width="356" /></p>
<p>After you select an option, you can tap the "&lt;" icon on the top-left corner of the screen, and you should see information in the conversation indicating that “disappearing messages” have been enabled.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2016/11/30/resized022.png" height="632" width="356" /></p>
<p>You can now send messages with the assurance that they will be removed after the chosen amount of time.</p>
