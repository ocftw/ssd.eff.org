But, do not fear! Security is a process, and through thoughtful planning, you can assess what’s right for you. Security isn’t about the tools you use or the software you download. It begins with understanding the unique threats you face and how you can counter those threats.</p>
<p>In computer security, a <a href="../glossary/threat.html" class="glossify-link" title="In computer security, a threat is a potential event that could undermine your efforts to defend your data. Threats can be intentional (conceived by attackers), or they could be accidental (you might leave your computer turned on and unguarded). ">threat<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a> is a potential event that could undermine your efforts to defend your data. You can counter the threats you face by determining what you need to protect and from whom you need to protect it. This process is called “threat modeling.”</p>
<p>This guide will teach you how to <a href="../glossary/threat-model.html" class="glossify-link" title="A way of narrowly thinking about the sorts of protection you want for your data. It's impossible to protect against every kind of trick or attacker, so you should concentrate on which people might want your data, what they might want from it, and how they might get it. Coming up with a set of possible attacks you plan to protect against is called threat modeling. Once you have a threat model, you can conduct a risk analysis. ">threat model<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a>, or how to assess your risks for your digital information and how to determine what solutions are best for you.</p>
<p>What might threat modeling look like? Let’s say you want to keep your house and possessions safe, here are a few questions you might ask:</p>
<p><strong><em>What do I have inside my home that is worth protecting?</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>Assets could include: jewelry, electronics, financial documents, passports, or photos</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>Who do I want to protect it from?</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>Adversaries could include: burglars, roommates, or guests</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>How likely is it that I will need to protect it?</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>Does my neighborhood have a history of burglaries? How trustworthy are my roommates/guests? What are the capabilities of my adversaries? What are the risks I should consider?</li>
</ul><p><em><strong>How bad are the consequences if I fail?</strong></em></p>
<ul><li>Do I have anything in my house that I cannot replace? Do I have the time or money to replace these things? Do I have insurance that covers goods stolen from my home?</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>How much trouble am I willing to go through to prevent these consequences?</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>Am I willing to buy a safe for sensitive documents? Can I afford to buy a high-quality lock? Do I have time to open a security box at my local bank and keep my valuables there?</li>
</ul><p>Once you have asked yourself these questions, you are in a position to assess what measures to take. If your possessions are valuable, but the risk of a break-in is low, then you may not want to invest too much money in a lock. But, if the risk is high, you’ll want to get the best lock on the market, and consider adding a security system.</p>
<p>Building a threat model helps you to understand the unique threats you face, your assets, your <a href="../glossary/adversary.html" class="glossify-link" title="Your adversary is the person or organization attempting to undermine your security goals. Adversaries can be different, depending on the situation. For instance, you may worry about criminals spying on the network at a cafe, or your classmates at a school. Often the adversary is hypothetical. ">adversary<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a>, your adversary’s capabilities, and the likelihood of risks you face.</p>

<ol><li>What do I want to protect?</li>
<li>Who do I want to protect it from?</li>
<li>How bad are the consequences if I fail?</li>
<li>How likely is it that I will need to protect it?</li>
<li>How much trouble am I willing to go through to try to prevent potential consequences?</li>
</ol><p>Let’s take a closer look at each of these questions.</p>
<h3>What do I want to protect?</h3>
<p>An “<a href="../glossary/asset.html" class="glossify-link" title="In threat modeling, any piece of data or a device that needs to be protected. ">asset<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a>” is something you value and want to protect. In the context of digital security, an asset is usually some kind of information. For example, your emails, contact lists, instant messages, location, and files are all possible assets. Your devices may also be assets.</p>
<p><em>Make a list of your assets: data that you keep, where it’s kept, who has access to it, and what stops others from accessing it.</em></p>
<h3>Who do I want to protect it from?</h3>
<p>To answer this question, it’s important to identify who might want to target you or your information. A person or entity that poses a threat to your assets is an “<a href="../glossary/adversary.html" class="glossify-link" title="Your adversary is the person or organization attempting to undermine your security goals. Adversaries can be different, depending on the situation. For instance, you may worry about criminals spying on the network at a cafe, or your classmates at a school. Often the adversary is hypothetical. ">adversary<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a>.” Examples of potential adversaries are your boss, your former partner, your business competition, your government, or a hacker on a public network.</p>
<p><em>Make a list of your adversaries, or those who might want to get ahold of your assets. Your list may include individuals, a government agency, or corporations.</em></p>
<p class="warning">Depending on who your adversaries are, under some circumstances this list might be something you want to destroy after you’re done threat modeling.</p>
<h3>How bad are the consequences if I fail?</h3>
<p>There are many ways that an adversary can threaten your data. For example, an adversary can read your private communications as they pass through the network, or they can delete or corrupt your data.</p>
<p>The motives of adversaries differ widely, as do their attacks. A government trying to prevent the spread of a video showing police violence may be content to simply delete or reduce the availability of that video. In contrast, a political opponent may wish to gain access to secret content and publish that content without you knowing.</p>
<p>Threat modeling involves understanding how bad the consequences could be if an adversary successfully attacks one of your assets. To determine this, you should consider the <a href="../glossary/capability.html" class="glossify-link" title="The capability of an attacker (in the sense we use it in this guide) is what it is able to do to achieve its aims. For example, a country's security services might have the capability to listen to telephone calls while a neighbor may have the capability to watch you from their window. To say that an attacker “has&quot; a capability does not mean that they will necessarily use that capability. It does mean that you should consider and prepare for the possibility. ">capability<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a> of your adversary. For example, your mobile phone provider has access to all your phone records and thus has the capability to use that data against you. A hacker on an open Wi-Fi network can access your unencrypted communications. Your government might have stronger capabilities.</p>
<p><em>Write down what your adversary might want to do with your private data.</em></p>
<h3>How likely is it that I will need to protect it?</h3>
<p>Risk is the likelihood that a particular threat against a particular asset will actually occur. It goes hand-in-hand with capability. While your mobile phone provider has the capability to access all of your data, the risk of them posting your private data online to harm your reputation is low.</p>
<p>It is important to distinguish between threats and risks. While a threat is a bad thing that can happen, risk is the likelihood that the threat will occur. For instance, there is a threat that your building might collapse, but the risk of this happening is far greater in San Francisco (where earthquakes are common) than in Stockholm (where they are not).</p>
<p>Conducting a <a href="../glossary/risk-analysis.html" class="glossify-link" title="In computer security, risk analysis is calculating the chance that threats might succeed, so you know how much effort to spend defending against them. There may be many different ways that you might lose control or access to your data, but some of them are less likely than others. Assessing risk means deciding which threats you are going to take seriously, and which may be too rare or too harmless (or too difficult to combat) to worry about. See threat modeling. ">risk analysis<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a> is both a personal and a subjective process; not everyone has the same priorities or views threats in the same way. Many people find certain threats unacceptable no matter what the risk, because the mere presence of the threat at any likelihood is not worth the cost. In other cases, people disregard high risks because they don't view the threat as a problem.</p>
<p><em>Write down which threats you are going to take seriously, and which may be too rare or too harmless (or too difficult to combat) to worry about.</em></p>
<h3>How much trouble am I willing to go through to try to prevent potential consequences?</h3>
<p>Answering this question requires conducting the risk analysis. Not everyone has the same priorities or views threats in the same way.</p>
<p>For example, an attorney representing a client in a national security case would probably be willing to go to greater lengths to protect communications about that case, such as using encrypted email, than a mother who regularly emails her daughter funny cat videos.</p>
<p><em>Write down what options you have available to you to help mitigate your unique threats. Note if you have any financial constraints, technical constraints, or social constraints.</em></p>

Threats can be intentional (conceived by attackers), or they could be accidental (you might leave your computer turned on and unguarded). ">Threat<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a> modeling as a regular practice <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#2">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>Keep in mind your <a href="../glossary/threat-model.html" class="glossify-link" title="A way of narrowly thinking about the sorts of protection you want for your data. It's impossible to protect against every kind of trick or attacker, so you should concentrate on which people might want your data, what they might want from it, and how they might get it.

">threat model<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a> can change as your situation changes. Thus, conducting frequent threat modeling assessments is good practice.</p>
<p class="tip">Create your own threat model based on your own unique situation. Then mark your calendar for a date in the future. This will prompt you to review your threat model and check back in to assess whether it’s still relevant to your situation.</p>

When Boris receives it, he must use his key to decrypt it into a readable message.</p>
<p>End-to-end encryption involves some effort, but it's the only way that users can verify the security of their communications without having to trust the platform that they're both using.

<p>What does transport-layer encryption do and why might you need it? HTTPS, also referred to as SSL or TLS, encrypts your communications so that it cannot be read by other people on your network. This can include the other people using the same Wi-Fi in an airport or at a café, the other people at your office or school, the administrators at your ISP, malicious hackers, governments, or law enforcement officials. Communications sent over your web browser, including the web pages that you visit and the content of your emails, blog posts, and messages, using HTTP rather than HTTPS are trivial for an attacker to intercept and read.</p>
<p>HTTPS is the most basic level of encryption for your web browsing that we recommend for everybody. It is as basic as putting on your seat belt when you drive.</p>
<p>But there are some things that HTTPS does not do. When you send email using HTTPS, your email provider still gets an unencrypted copy of your communication. Governments and law enforcement may be able to access this data with a warrant. In the United States, most email providers have a policy that says they will tell you when you have received a government request for your user data as long as they are legally allowed to do so, but these policies are strictly voluntary, and in many cases providers are legally prevented from informing their users of requests for data. Some email providers, such as Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft, publish transparency reports, detailing the number of government requests for user data they receive, which countries make the requests, and how often the company has complied by turning over data.</p>

<p class="warning">BitLocker's code is closed and proprietary, which means it is hard for external reviewers to know exactly how secure it is. Using BitLocker requires you trust Microsoft provides a secure storage system without hidden vulnerabilities. On the other hand, if you're already using Windows, you are already trusting Microsoft to the same extent. If you are worried about surveillance from the kind of attackers who might know of or benefit from a back door in either Windows or BitLocker, you may wish to consider an alternative open-source <a href="../glossary/operating-system.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="operating system" title="A program that runs all the other programs on a computer.

At the time this guide was updated, we do not have a full disk encryption tool for versions of Windows that do not include BitLocker that we can recommend.</p>
<p>Whatever your device calls it, encryption is only as good as your password. If your attacker has your device, they have all the time in the world to try out new passwords. Forensic software can try millions of passwords a second. That means that a four number pin is unlikely to protect your data for very long at all, and even a long password may merely slow down your attacker. A really strong password under these conditions should be over fifteen characters long.</p>
<p>Most of us are not realistically going to learn and enter such passphrases on our phones or mobile devices. So while encryption can be useful to prevent casual access, you should preserve truly confidential data by keeping it hidden from physical access by attackers, or cordoned away on a much more secure machine.</p>
</div><div class="field-item odd"><a name="1"></a> <h2>Create a Secure Machine <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#1">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>Maintaining a secure environment can be hard work. At best, you have to change passwords, habits, and perhaps the software you use on your main computer or device. At worst, you have to constantly think about whether you're leaking confidential information or using unsafe practices. Even when you know the problems, some solutions may be out of your hands. Other people might require you to continue unsafe digital security practices even after you have explained the dangers. For instance, work colleagues might want you to continue to open email attachments from them, even though you know your attackers could impersonate them and send you <a href="../glossary/malware.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="malware" title="Malware is short for malicious software: programs that are designed to conduct unwanted actions on your device.

Or you may be concerned that your main computer has already been compromised.</p>
<p>One strategy to consider is cordoning off valuable data and communications onto a more secure computer. Use that machine only occasionally, and when you do, consciously take much more care over your actions. If you need to open attachments, or use insecure software, do it on another machine.</p>
<p class="tip">If you're setting up a secure machine, what extra steps can you take to make it secure?</p>
<p>You can almost certainly keep the device in a more physically safe place: somewhere where you are able to tell if it has been tampered with, such as a locked cabinet.</p>
<p>You can install a privacy- and security-focused <a href="../glossary/operating-system.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="operating system" title="A program that runs all the other programs on a computer.

You might not be able (or want) to use an open source operating system in your everyday work, but if you just need to store, edit and write confidential emails or instant messages from this secure device, Tails will work well, and defaults to high security settings.</p>
<p>An extra, secure computer may not be as expensive an option as you think. A computer that is seldom used, and only runs a few programs, does not need to be particularly fast or new. You can buy an older netbook for a fraction of the price of a modern laptop or phone. Older machines also have the advantage that secure software like Tails may be more likely to work with them than newer models.</p>
<p>You can use the secure machine to keep the primary copy of confidential data. A secure machine can be valuable in cordoning off private data in this way, but you should also consider a couple of extra risks it might create.

Encrypt a copy and keep it somewhere else.</p>
<p>The highest level of protection from Internet attacks or online surveillance is, not surprisingly, not connecting to the Internet at all. You could make sure your secure computer never connects to a local network or Wifi, and only copy files onto the machine using physical media, like DVDs or USB drives. In network security, this is known as having an "<a href="../glossary/air-gap.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="air gap" title="A computer or network that is physically isolated from all other networks, including the Internet, is said to be air-gapped.

Not many people go this far, but it can be an option if you want to keep data that is rarely accessed but you never want to lose. Examples might be an <a href="../glossary/encryption-key.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="encryption key" title="An encryption key is a piece of information that is used to convert a message into an unreadable form.

In most of these cases, you might want to consider just having a hidden storage device, rather than a full computer.

<p>If you do use the secure device to connect to the Internet, you might choose not to log in or use your usual accounts. Create separate web or email accounts that you use for communications from this device, and use Tor to keep your <a href="../glossary/ip-address.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="IP address" title="A device on the Internet needs its own address to receive data, just like a home or business needs a street address to receive physical mail.

<p class="tip">A variation on the idea of a secure machine is to have an <em>insecure machine: </em>a device that you only use when you are going into dangerous places or need to try a risky operation. Many journalists and activists, for instance, take a minimal netbook with them when they travel. This computer does not have any of their documents, usual contact or email information on it, and so is less of a loss if it is confiscated or scanned. You can apply the same strategy to mobile phones. If you usually use a smartphone, consider buying a cheap throwaway or <a href="../glossary/burner-phone.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="burner phone" title="A phone that is not connected to your identity, is only used for a small set of calls or activities, and can be discarded if and when it is suspected of being tracked or compromised.

Did you know that the government has the right to, without a warrant, search travelers at the border—including when they land at international airports—as part of its traditional power to control the flow of items into the country? (Note that although some of the same legal justifications exist for searches of those leaving the US and that such searches are possible, travelers are not routinely searched on their way out of the country.)</p>

</div><div class="field-item odd"><a name="1"></a> <h2>In the Meantime, Here are Some Things to Keep in Mind When Crossing the US Border: <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#1">Anchor link</a></h2>
<ul><li>
<p>Have you backed up your devices? This may help in case one or more of your devices is seized. You can use an online backup service or an external hard drive, though we don't recommend carrying both your laptop and your backup hard drive at the same time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you need to be carrying so much data? We suggest minimizing the amount of data you are carrying over the border. Consider traveling with a "clean" laptop, and note that simply dragging files to your trash doesn't delete them completely. Make sure you securely delete your files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are your devices encrypted? We recommend full-disk <a href="../glossary/encryption.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="encryption" title="A process that takes a message and makes it unreadable except to a person who knows how to &quot;decrypt&quot; it back into a readable form.

">encryption<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/themes/ssd/img/info.png" /></a> on your devices (laptops, mobile phones, etc.) and choosing secure passphrases. If a border agent asks for your <a href="../glossary/passphrase.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="passphrase" title="A passphrase is a kind of password.

Only a judge can force you to reveal such information. However, refusal to comply could bear consequences: for noncitizens, you may be refused entry into the country; for citizens, you may be detained until the border patrol decides what to do, which may include seizing your computer, phone, camera, USB sticks, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you enter a new country, consider purchasing a temporary phone and transferring your <a href="../glossary/sim-card.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="SIM card" title="A small, removable card that can be inserted into a mobile phone in order to provide service with a particular mobile phone company.

This phone will carry far less data than your normal phone.</p>

<p>When dealing with border guards, remember these three things:<em> Be courteous, do not lie</em>, and <em>do not</em> physically interfere with the agent’s search.</p>

An example of such an attack is tricking an employee to install malware on their laptop. To allow employees to access the intranet via the wider Internet, companies will often provide their own Virtual Private Network (VPN) which creates a secure connection to the inside of the intranet from anywhere in the world.
