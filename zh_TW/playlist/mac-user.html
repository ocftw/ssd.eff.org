But, do not fear! Security is a process, and through thoughtful planning, you can assess what’s right for you. Security isn’t about the tools you use or the software you download. It begins with understanding the unique threats you face and how you can counter those threats.</p>
<p>In computer security, a <a href="../glossary/threat.html" class="glossify-link" title="In computer security, a threat is a potential event that could undermine your efforts to defend your data. Threats can be intentional (conceived by attackers), or they could be accidental (you might leave your computer turned on and unguarded). ">threat<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a> is a potential event that could undermine your efforts to defend your data. You can counter the threats you face by determining what you need to protect and from whom you need to protect it. This process is called “threat modeling.”</p>
<p>This guide will teach you how to <a href="../glossary/threat-model.html" class="glossify-link" title="A way of narrowly thinking about the sorts of protection you want for your data. It's impossible to protect against every kind of trick or attacker, so you should concentrate on which people might want your data, what they might want from it, and how they might get it. Coming up with a set of possible attacks you plan to protect against is called threat modeling. Once you have a threat model, you can conduct a risk analysis. ">threat model<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a>, or how to assess your risks for your digital information and how to determine what solutions are best for you.</p>
<p>What might threat modeling look like? Let’s say you want to keep your house and possessions safe, here are a few questions you might ask:</p>
<p><strong><em>What do I have inside my home that is worth protecting?</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>Assets could include: jewelry, electronics, financial documents, passports, or photos</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>Who do I want to protect it from?</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>Adversaries could include: burglars, roommates, or guests</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>How likely is it that I will need to protect it?</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>Does my neighborhood have a history of burglaries? How trustworthy are my roommates/guests? What are the capabilities of my adversaries? What are the risks I should consider?</li>
</ul><p><em><strong>How bad are the consequences if I fail?</strong></em></p>
<ul><li>Do I have anything in my house that I cannot replace? Do I have the time or money to replace these things? Do I have insurance that covers goods stolen from my home?</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>How much trouble am I willing to go through to prevent these consequences?</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>Am I willing to buy a safe for sensitive documents? Can I afford to buy a high-quality lock? Do I have time to open a security box at my local bank and keep my valuables there?</li>
</ul><p>Once you have asked yourself these questions, you are in a position to assess what measures to take. If your possessions are valuable, but the risk of a break-in is low, then you may not want to invest too much money in a lock. But, if the risk is high, you’ll want to get the best lock on the market, and consider adding a security system.</p>
<p>Building a threat model helps you to understand the unique threats you face, your assets, your <a href="../glossary/adversary.html" class="glossify-link" title="Your adversary is the person or organization attempting to undermine your security goals. Adversaries can be different, depending on the situation. For instance, you may worry about criminals spying on the network at a cafe, or your classmates at a school. Often the adversary is hypothetical. ">adversary<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a>, your adversary’s capabilities, and the likelihood of risks you face.</p>

">asset<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a>” is something you value and want to protect. In the context of digital security, an asset is usually some kind of information. For example, your emails, contact lists, instant messages, location, and files are all possible assets. Your devices may also be assets.</p>
<p><em>Make a list of your assets: data that you keep, where it’s kept, who has access to it, and what stops others from accessing it.</em></p>
<h3>Who do I want to protect it from?</h3>
<p>To answer this question, it’s important to identify who might want to target you or your information. A person or entity that poses a threat to your assets is an “<a href="../glossary/adversary.html" class="glossify-link" title="Your adversary is the person or organization attempting to undermine your security goals. Adversaries can be different, depending on the situation. For instance, you may worry about criminals spying on the network at a cafe, or your classmates at a school. Often the adversary is hypothetical. ">adversary<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a>.” Examples of potential adversaries are your boss, your former partner, your business competition, your government, or a hacker on a public network.</p>
<p><em>Make a list of your adversaries, or those who might want to get ahold of your assets. Your list may include individuals, a government agency, or corporations.</em></p>
<p class="warning">Depending on who your adversaries are, under some circumstances this list might be something you want to destroy after you’re done threat modeling.</p>
<h3>How bad are the consequences if I fail?</h3>
<p>There are many ways that an adversary can threaten your data. For example, an adversary can read your private communications as they pass through the network, or they can delete or corrupt your data.</p>
<p>The motives of adversaries differ widely, as do their attacks. A government trying to prevent the spread of a video showing police violence may be content to simply delete or reduce the availability of that video. In contrast, a political opponent may wish to gain access to secret content and publish that content without you knowing.</p>
<p>Threat modeling involves understanding how bad the consequences could be if an adversary successfully attacks one of your assets. To determine this, you should consider the <a href="../glossary/capability.html" class="glossify-link" title="The capability of an attacker (in the sense we use it in this guide) is what it is able to do to achieve its aims. For example, a country's security services might have the capability to listen to telephone calls while a neighbor may have the capability to watch you from their window. To say that an attacker “has&quot; a capability does not mean that they will necessarily use that capability. It does mean that you should consider and prepare for the possibility. ">capability<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a> of your adversary. For example, your mobile phone provider has access to all your phone records and thus has the capability to use that data against you. A hacker on an open Wi-Fi network can access your unencrypted communications. Your government might have stronger capabilities.</p>
<p><em>Write down what your adversary might want to do with your private data.</em></p>
<h3>How likely is it that I will need to protect it?</h3>
<p>Risk is the likelihood that a particular threat against a particular asset will actually occur. It goes hand-in-hand with capability. While your mobile phone provider has the capability to access all of your data, the risk of them posting your private data online to harm your reputation is low.</p>
<p>It is important to distinguish between threats and risks. While a threat is a bad thing that can happen, risk is the likelihood that the threat will occur. For instance, there is a threat that your building might collapse, but the risk of this happening is far greater in San Francisco (where earthquakes are common) than in Stockholm (where they are not).</p>
<p>Conducting a <a href="../glossary/risk-analysis.html" class="glossify-link" title="In computer security, risk analysis is calculating the chance that threats might succeed, so you know how much effort to spend defending against them. There may be many different ways that you might lose control or access to your data, but some of them are less likely than others. Assessing risk means deciding which threats you are going to take seriously, and which may be too rare or too harmless (or too difficult to combat) to worry about. See threat modeling. ">risk analysis<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a> is both a personal and a subjective process; not everyone has the same priorities or views threats in the same way. Many people find certain threats unacceptable no matter what the risk, because the mere presence of the threat at any likelihood is not worth the cost. In other cases, people disregard high risks because they don't view the threat as a problem.</p>
<p><em>Write down which threats you are going to take seriously, and which may be too rare or too harmless (or too difficult to combat) to worry about.</em></p>
<h3>How much trouble am I willing to go through to try to prevent potential consequences?</h3>
<p>Answering this question requires conducting the risk analysis. Not everyone has the same priorities or views threats in the same way.</p>
<p>For example, an attorney representing a client in a national security case would probably be willing to go to greater lengths to protect communications about that case, such as using encrypted email, than a mother who regularly emails her daughter funny cat videos.</p>
<p><em>Write down what options you have available to you to help mitigate your unique threats. Note if you have any financial constraints, technical constraints, or social constraints.</em></p>

<p>Keep in mind your <a href="../glossary/threat-model.html" class="glossify-link" title="A way of narrowly thinking about the sorts of protection you want for your data. It's impossible to protect against every kind of trick or attacker, so you should concentrate on which people might want your data, what they might want from it, and how they might get it.

Thus, conducting frequent threat modeling assessments is good practice.</p>
<p class="tip">Create your own threat model based on your own unique situation. Then mark your calendar for a date in the future. This will prompt you to review your threat model and check back in to assess whether it’s still relevant to your situation.</p>

<p>Some webmail providers that use HTTPS by default include:</p>

</ul><p>Some webmail providers that give you the option of choosing to use HTTPS by default by selecting it in your settings. The most popular service that still does this is Hotmail.</p>
<p>What does transport-layer encryption do and why might you need it? HTTPS, also referred to as SSL or TLS, encrypts your communications so that it cannot be read by other people on your network. This can include the other people using the same Wi-Fi in an airport or at a café, the other people at your office or school, the administrators at your ISP, malicious hackers, governments, or law enforcement officials. Communications sent over your web browser, including the web pages that you visit and the content of your emails, blog posts, and messages, using HTTP rather than HTTPS are trivial for an attacker to intercept and read.</p>
<p>HTTPS is the most basic level of encryption for your web browsing that we recommend for everybody. It is as basic as putting on your seat belt when you drive.</p>
<p>But there are some things that HTTPS does not do. When you send email using HTTPS, your email provider still gets an unencrypted copy of your communication. Governments and law enforcement may be able to access this data with a warrant. In the United States, most email providers have a policy that says they will tell you when you have received a government request for your user data as long as they are legally allowed to do so, but these policies are strictly voluntary, and in many cases providers are legally prevented from informing their users of requests for data. Some email providers, such as Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft, publish transparency reports, detailing the number of government requests for user data they receive, which countries make the requests, and how often the company has complied by turning over data.</p>

<p>Once you have signed in to one or more of your accounts, you can start using OTR.</p>
<p class="tip">Remember: In order to have a conversation using OTR, both people need to be using a chat program that supports OTR.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Initiate an OTR Chat</h3>
<p>First, identify someone who is using OTR, and initiate a conversation with them in Adium by double-clicking on their name. Once you have opened the chat window, you will see a small, open lock in the upper left-hand corner of the chat window. Click on the lock and select “Initiate Encrypted OTR Chat.”</p>
<h3>Step 2: Verify Your Connection</h3>
<p>Once you have initiated the chat and the other person has accepted the invitation, you will see the lock icon close; this is how you know that your chat is now encrypted (congratulations!) – But wait, there’s still another step!</p>
<p>At this time, you have initiated an unverified, encrypted chat. This means that while your communications are encrypted, you have not yet determined and verified the identity of the person you are chatting with. Unless you are in the same room and can see each other’s screens, it is important that you verify each other’s identities. For more information, read the module on <a href="../module/key-verification.html#overlay=en/node/37/" target="_blank">Key Verification</a>.</p>
<p>To verify another user’s identity using Adium, click again on the lock, and select “Verify.” You will be shown a window that displays both your <a href="../glossary/key.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="key" title="In cryptography, a piece of data which gives you the capability to encrypt or decrypt a message.

The fingerprints presented by cryptographic software usually consist of around 40 letters and numbers. If you carefully check that a fingerprint has the right value, you should be safe against impersonation using a fake key.

<p>The easiest way to do this is to read them aloud to one another in person, but that’s not always possible. There are different ways to accomplish this with varying degrees of trustworthiness.

<p class="warning">The most important thing is that you verify that every single letter and digit matches perfectly.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Disable Logging</h3>
<p>Now that you have initiated an encrypted chat and verified your chat partner’s identity, there’s one more thing you need to do. Unfortunately, Adium logs your OTR-encrypted chats by default, saving them to your hard drive. This means that, despite the fact that they’re encrypted, they are being saved in plain text on your hard drive.</p>
<p>To <a href="https://trac.adium.im/wiki/MessageHistory" rel="noreferrer">disable logging</a>, click “Adium” in the menu at the top of your screen, then “Preferences.” In the new window, select “General” and then disable “Log messages” and “Log OTR-secured chats.” Remember, though, that you do not have control over the person with whom you are chatting—she could be logging or taking screenshots of your conversation, even if you yourself have disabled logging.</p>
<p>Your settings should now look like this:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/field/image/adium_3.png" /></p>
<p wrap="">Also, when Adium displays notifications of new messages, the contents of those messages may be logged by the OS X Notification Center. This means that while Adium leaves no trace of your communications on your own computer or your correspondent's, either your or their computer's version of OS X may preserve a record. To prevent this, you may want to disable notifications.</p>
<p wrap="">To do this, select "Events" in the Preferences window, and look for any entries that say "Display a notification." For each entry, expand it by clicking the gray triangle, and then click the newly-exposed line that say "Display a notification," then click the minus icon ("-") at the lower left to remove that line."

<p>What this guide teaches is how to use PGP with Mozilla Thunderbird, an email client program that performs a similar function to Outlook. You may have your own favorite email software program (or use a web mail service like Gmail or Outlook.com). This guide won't tell you how to use PGP with these programs. You can choose either to install Thunderbird and experiment with PGP with a new email client, or you can investigate other solutions to use PGP with your customary software. We have still not found a satisfactory solution for these other programs.</p>

">PGP<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/themes/ssd/img/info.png" /></a>) is a way to protect your email communications from being read by anyone except their intended recipients. It can protect against companies, governments, or criminals spying on your Internet connection, and, to a lesser extent, it can save your email from being read if the computer on which they are stored is stolen or broken into.</p>
<p>It can also be used to prove that an email came from a particular person, instead of being a fake message sent by another sender (it is otherwise very easy for email to be fabricated). Both of these are important defenses if you're being targeted for surveillance or misinformation.</p>
<p>To use PGP, you will need to install some extra software that will work with your current email program. You will also need to create a private <a href="../glossary/key.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="key" title="In cryptography, a piece of data which gives you the capability to encrypt or decrypt a message.

<p class="tip">Your key will expire at a certain time; when that happens, other people will stop using it entirely for new emails to you, though you might not get any warning or explanation about why. So, you may want to mark your calendar and pay attention to this issue a month or so before the expiration date.</p>
<p>It's possible to extend the lifetime of an existing key by giving it a new, later expiration date, or it's possible to replace it with a new key by creating a fresh one from scratch. Both processes might require contacting people who email you and making sure that they get the updated key; current software isn't very good at automating this. So make a reminder for yourself; if you don't think you'll be able to manage it, you can consider setting the key so that it never expires, though in that case other people might try to use it when contacting you far in the future even if you no longer have the private key or no longer use <a href="../glossary/pgp.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="PGP" title="PGP or Pretty Good Privacy was one of the first popular implementations of public key cryptography.

<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2016/08/16/51.png" width="309" height="151" /></p>
<p>A small window will pop up with a search field. You can search by a complete email address, a partial email address, or a name. In this case, you will search for keys containing “<a href="mailto:samir@samirnassar.com" rel="noreferrer">samir@samirnassar.com</a>”. <em>Click the “OK” button.</em></p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2016/08/16/52.png" width="649" height="454" /></p>
<p>A larger window will pop up with many options. If you scroll down you'll notice some keys are italicized and grayed out. These are keys that have either been revoked or expired on their own.</p>
<p>We have several PGP keys for Samir Nassar and we don’t yet know which one to choose. One key is in grey italics which means that it has been revoked. Because we don’t know which one we want yet, we will import them all. <em>Select the keys by clicking the box on the left then press the “OK” button.</em></p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2016/08/16/53.png" width="754" height="268" /></p>

<p>A window will pop open asking you if you forgot to add an attachment. This is a bug in the interaction between Enigmail and Mozilla Thunderbird, but don’t worry, your public key will be attached. <em>Click the “No, Send Now” button.</em></p>
<h3>Let people know you are using PGP on your website</h3>
<p>In addition to letting people know via email, you can post your public key on your website. The easiest way is to upload the file and link to it. This guide won't go into how to do those things, but you should know how to export the key as a file to use in the future.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2016/08/16/37.png" width="706" height="117" /></p>
<p><em>Click the configuration button, then the Enigmail option, then Key Management.</em></p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2016/08/16/58.png" width="326" height="418" /></p>
<p><em>Highlight the key in bold, then right-click to bring up the menu and select Export keys to file.</em></p>

<p>A small window will pop up with three buttons. <em>Click the “Export Public Keys Only” button</em>.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2016/08/16/60.png" width="432" height="231" /></p>
<p>Now a window will open so you can save the file. In order to make it easier to find in the future please save the file to the Documents folder. Now you can use this file as you wish.</p>
<p class="warning">Make sure you don't click the “Export Secret Keys” button because exporting the secret key could allow others to impersonate you if they are able to guess your <a href="../glossary/password.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="password" title="A secret meant to be memorized, and meant to limit access to something so that only someone who knows the password can gain access.

<h3>Uploading to a keyserver</h3>
<p>Keyservers make it easier to search for and download public keys of others. Most modern keyservers are synchronizing, meaning that a public key uploaded to one server will eventually reach all servers.</p>
<p>Although uploading your public key to a keyserver might be a convenient way of letting people know that you have a public PGP certificate, you should know that due to the nature of how keyservers work there is no way to delete public keys once they are uploaded.</p>
<p class="tip">Before uploading your public key to a keyserver, it is good to take a moment to consider whether you want the whole world to know that you have a public certificate without the ability to remove this information at a later time.</p>
<p>If you choose to upload your public key to keyservers, you will go back to the Enigmail Key Management window.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2016/08/16/58.png" width="326" height="418" /></p>
<p>Right-click your PGP key and select the Upload Public Keys to Keyserver option.</p>
<a name="8"></a> <h2>Sending PGP Encrypted Mail <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#8">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>Now you will send your first encrypted email to a recipient.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2016/08/16/55.png" width="384" height="79" /></p>
<p>In the main Mozilla Thunderbird window <em>click the “Write” button</em>. A new window will open.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2016/08/16/63a.png" width="595" height="382" /></p>
<p>Write your message, and enter a recipient. For this test, select a recipient whose public key you already have. Enigmail will detect this and automatically encrypt the email.</p>
<p class="warning">The subject line won't be encrypted, so choose something innocuous, like "hello."</p>
<p>The body of the email was encrypted and transformed. For example the text above will be transformed into something like this:<img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2014/10/13/290pgpmessage.png" /></p>

<h3>Revoking Your PGP Key Through the Enigmail Interface</h3>
<p>The PGP keys generated by Enigmail automatically expire after five years. So if you lose all your files, you can hope that people will know to ask you for another key once the key has expired.</p>
<p>You might have a good reason to disable the PGP key before it expires. Perhaps you want to generate a new, stronger PGP key. The easiest way to revoke your own PGP key in Enigmail is through the Enigmail Key Manager.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2016/08/16/37.png" width="706" height="117" /></p>
<p>Right click on your PGP key, it's in bold, and <em>select the "Revoke Key" option.</em></p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2016/08/16/66.png" width="476" height="244" /></p>
<p>A window will pop up letting you know what happens and asking for your confirmation. <em>Click the “Revoke Key” button.</em></p>

<p>Like we mentioned before, you might have a good reason to disable the PGP key before it expires. Similarly, others might have good reasons to revoke an existing key. In the previous section you might have noticed that Enigmail generates and imports a revocation certificate internally when you use the Enigmail Key Manager to revoke a key.</p>
<p>You might get sent revocation certificates from friends as a notice that they want to revoke their key. Since you already have a revocation certificate, you will use the one you generated earlier to revoke your own key.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2016/08/16/42.png" width="437" height="201" /></p>
<p>Start with the Enigmail Key Manager and <em>click the “File” menu and select “Import Keys from File.”</em></p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2016/08/16/67.png" width="709" height="465" /></p>
<p>A window will open up so you can select the revocation certificate. <em>Click on the file, and click the “Open” button. </em></p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2016/08/16/69.png" width="480" height="148" /></p>
<p>You'll get a notification that the certificate was imported successfully and that a key was revoked. <em>Click the “OK” button.</em></p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ssd.eff.org/files/2016/08/16/68.png" width="706" height="164" /></p>
<p>When you go back to the Enigmail Key Management window you'll notice a change to your PGP key. It is now grayed out and italicized.</p>
<p>Now that you have all the proper tools, try sending your own PGP-encrypted email.</p>

<p>Now that you understand how KeePassX works, let’s get started with actually using it!</p>
</div><div class="field-item even"><a name="4"></a> <h2>Getting Started with KeePassX <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#4">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>Once you’ve installed KeePassX, go ahead and launch it. Once it’s started, select “New Database” from the File menu. A dialog will pop up which will ask you to enter a <a href="../glossary/master-password.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="master password" title="A password used to unlock a store of other passwords or other ways to unlock programs or messages. You should make a master password as strong as you can.

Select the appropriate checkbox(es) based on your choice. Note that if you want to see the <a href="../glossary/password.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="password" title="A secret meant to be memorized, and meant to limit access to something so that only someone who knows the password can gain access.

Also note that you can use any existing file as a keyfile—an image of your cat for example, could be used as a keyfile. You’ll just need to make sure the file you choose never gets modified, because if its contents are changed then it will no longer work for decrypting your password database. Also be aware that sometimes opening a file in another program can be enough to modify it; the best practice is to not open the file except to unlock KeePassX. (It is safe to move or rename the keyfile, though.)</p>
<p>Once you’ve successfully initialized your password database, you should save it by choosing “Save Database” from the File menu. (Note that if you want, you can move the password database file later to wherever you like on your hard disk, or move it to other computers—you’ll still be able to open it using KeePassX and the password/keyfile you specified before.)</p>
</div><div class="field-item odd"><a name="5"></a> <h2>Organizing Passwords <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#5">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>KeePassX allows you to organize passwords into “Groups,” which are basically just folders. You can create, delete, or edit Groups or Subgroups by going to the “Groups” menu in the menubar, or by right-clicking on a Group in the left-hand pane of the KeePassX window. Grouping passwords doesn’t affect any of the functionality of KeePassX—it’s just a handy organizational tool.</p>

For basic password usage, do the following:</p>
<ul><li>Enter a descriptive title you can use to recognize this password entry in the “Title” field.</li>
<li>Enter the username associated with this password entry in the “Username” field. (This can be blank if there is no username.)</li>
<li>Enter your password in the “Password” field. If you’re creating a new password (i.e. if you’re signing up for a new website and you want to create a new, unique, random password) click the “Gen” button to the right. This will pop up a password generator dialog which you can use to generate a random password. There are several options in this dialog, including what sorts of characters to include and how long to make the password.
<ul><li>Note that if you generate a random password, it’s not necessary that you remember (or even know!) what that password is! KeePassX stores it for you, and any time you need it you’ll be able to copy/paste it into the appropriate program. This is the whole point of a password safe—you can use different long random passwords for <em>each</em> website/service, without even knowing what the passwords are!</li>
<li>Because of this, you should make the password as long as the service will allow and use as many different types of characters as possible.</li>
<li>Once you’re satisfied with the options, click “Generate” in the lower right to generate the password, and then click “OK.” The generated random password will automatically be entered in the “Password” and “Repeat” fields for you. (If you’re not generating a random password, then you’ll need to enter your chosen password again in the “Repeat” field.)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><ul><li>Finally, click OK. Your password is now stored in your password database. To make sure the changes are saved, be sure to save the edited password database by going to “File &gt; Save Database.” (Alternatively, if you made a mistake, you can close and then re-open the database file and all changes will be lost.)</li>
</ul><p>If you ever need to change/edit the stored password, you can just choose the Group it’s in and then double-click on its title in the right-hand pane, and the “New Entry” dialog will pop up again.</p>

<p>To enable this feature, do the following.</p>
<p><em>1. Choose your global hotkey.</em> Choose “Settings” from the “Extras” menu, and then choose “Advanced” in the pane on the left. Click inside the “Global Auto-Type Shortcut” field, and then press the shortcut-<a href="../glossary/key.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="key" title="In cryptography, a piece of data which gives you the capability to encrypt or decrypt a message. " data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" data-html="true" data-toggle="popover" data-container="body" data-content="In cryptography, a piece of data which gives you the capability to encrypt or decrypt a message. ">key<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/themes/ssd/img/info.png" /></a> combination you wish to use. (For example, press and hold Ctrl, Alt, and Shift, and then hit “p.” You can use any key combination you like, but you’ll want to make sure that it doesn’t conflict with hotkeys other applications use, so try to stay away from things like Ctrl+X or Alt+F4.) Once you’re satisfied, click “OK.”</p>
<p><em>2. Setup auto-type for a specific password.</em> Make sure that you have the window open where you’ll want to enter the password. Then go to KeePassX, find the entry for which you want to enable auto-type, and double-click on the entry’s title to open up the “New Entry” dialog.</p>
<p>3. Click the “Tools” button in the bottom left, and select “Auto-Type: Select target window.” In the dialog that pops up, expand the drop-down box and choose the title of the window in which you want the username and password to be entered. Click OK, and then click OK again.</p>
<p><em>Test it out!</em> Now in order to autotype your username and password, go to the window/website where you want KeePassX to autotype your username/password for you. Make sure your cursor is in the text box for your username, and then hit the combination of keys you chose above for the global hotkey. As long as KeePassX is open (even if it’s minimized or not focused) your username and password should automatically be entered.</p>
<p>Note that depending on how the website/window is set up, this feature may not work 100% correctly right off the bat. (It might enter the username but not the password, for example.) You can troubleshoot and customize this feature, though—for more information we recommend looking at the KeePass documentation <a href="http://keepass.info/help/base/autotype.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>. (Although there are some differences between KeePass and KeePassX, that page should be enough to guide you in the right direction.)</p>
<p>It is recommended that you use a key combination that is difficult to hit accidentally. You don't want to accidentally paste your bank account password into a Facebook post!</p>
</div><div class="field-item odd"><a name="9"></a> <h2>Other Features <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#9">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>You can search your database by typing something in the search box (the text box in the toolbar of the main KeePassX window) and hitting enter.</p>
<p>You can also sort your entries by clicking on the column header in the main window.</p>
<p>You can also “lock” KeePassX by choosing “File &gt; Lock Workspace,” so that you can leave KeePassX open, but have it ask for your <a href="../glossary/master-password.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="master password" title="A password used to unlock a store of other passwords or other ways to unlock programs or messages.

You can also have KeePassX automatically lock itself after a certain period of inactivity. This can prevent someone from accessing your passwords if you step away from your computer. To enable this feature, choose “Extras &gt; Settings” from the menu and click on the security options. Then check the box that says “Lock database after inactivity of {number} seconds.”</p>
<p>KeePassX can also store more than just usernames and passwords. For example, you can create entries to store important things like account numbers, or product keys, or serial numbers, or anything else. There’s no requirement that the data you put in the “Password” field actually has to be a password. It can be anything you want—just input what you want to store in the “Password” field instead of an actual password (and leave the “Username” field blank if there’s no username) and KeePassX will safely and securely remember it for you.</p>
<p>KeePassX is easy to use, robust software, and we recommend exploring the program to learn all of the useful things it can do.</p>
