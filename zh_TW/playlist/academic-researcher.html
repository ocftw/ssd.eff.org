But, do not fear! Security is a process, and through thoughtful planning, you can assess what’s right for you. Security isn’t about the tools you use or the software you download. It begins with understanding the unique threats you face and how you can counter those threats.</p>
<p>In computer security, a <a href="../glossary/threat.html" class="glossify-link" title="In computer security, a threat is a potential event that could undermine your efforts to defend your data. Threats can be intentional (conceived by attackers), or they could be accidental (you might leave your computer turned on and unguarded). ">threat<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a> is a potential event that could undermine your efforts to defend your data. You can counter the threats you face by determining what you need to protect and from whom you need to protect it. This process is called “threat modeling.”</p>
<p>This guide will teach you how to <a href="../glossary/threat-model.html" class="glossify-link" title="A way of narrowly thinking about the sorts of protection you want for your data. It's impossible to protect against every kind of trick or attacker, so you should concentrate on which people might want your data, what they might want from it, and how they might get it. Coming up with a set of possible attacks you plan to protect against is called threat modeling. Once you have a threat model, you can conduct a risk analysis. ">threat model<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a>, or how to assess your risks for your digital information and how to determine what solutions are best for you.</p>
<p>What might threat modeling look like? Let’s say you want to keep your house and possessions safe, here are a few questions you might ask:</p>
<p><strong><em>What do I have inside my home that is worth protecting?</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>Assets could include: jewelry, electronics, financial documents, passports, or photos</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>Who do I want to protect it from?</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>Adversaries could include: burglars, roommates, or guests</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>How likely is it that I will need to protect it?</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>Does my neighborhood have a history of burglaries? How trustworthy are my roommates/guests? What are the capabilities of my adversaries? What are the risks I should consider?</li>
</ul><p><em><strong>How bad are the consequences if I fail?</strong></em></p>
<ul><li>Do I have anything in my house that I cannot replace? Do I have the time or money to replace these things? Do I have insurance that covers goods stolen from my home?</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>How much trouble am I willing to go through to prevent these consequences?</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>Am I willing to buy a safe for sensitive documents? Can I afford to buy a high-quality lock? Do I have time to open a security box at my local bank and keep my valuables there?</li>
</ul><p>Once you have asked yourself these questions, you are in a position to assess what measures to take. If your possessions are valuable, but the risk of a break-in is low, then you may not want to invest too much money in a lock. But, if the risk is high, you’ll want to get the best lock on the market, and consider adding a security system.</p>
<p>Building a threat model helps you to understand the unique threats you face, your assets, your <a href="../glossary/adversary.html" class="glossify-link" title="Your adversary is the person or organization attempting to undermine your security goals. Adversaries can be different, depending on the situation. For instance, you may worry about criminals spying on the network at a cafe, or your classmates at a school. Often the adversary is hypothetical. ">adversary<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a>, your adversary’s capabilities, and the likelihood of risks you face.</p>

It's impossible to protect against every kind of trick or attacker, so you should concentrate on which people might want your data, what they might want from it, and how they might get it. Coming up with a set of possible attacks you plan to protect against is called threat modeling. Once you have a threat model, you can conduct a risk analysis. ">threat model<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a>, answer these five questions:</p>
<ol><li>What do I want to protect?</li>
<li>Who do I want to protect it from?</li>
<li>How bad are the consequences if I fail?</li>
<li>How likely is it that I will need to protect it?</li>
<li>How much trouble am I willing to go through to try to prevent potential consequences?</li>
</ol><p>Let’s take a closer look at each of these questions.</p>
<h3>What do I want to protect?</h3>
<p>An “<a href="../glossary/asset.html" class="glossify-link" title="In threat modeling, any piece of data or a device that needs to be protected. ">asset<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a>” is something you value and want to protect. In the context of digital security, an asset is usually some kind of information. For example, your emails, contact lists, instant messages, location, and files are all possible assets. Your devices may also be assets.</p>
<p><em>Make a list of your assets: data that you keep, where it’s kept, who has access to it, and what stops others from accessing it.</em></p>
<h3>Who do I want to protect it from?</h3>
<p>To answer this question, it’s important to identify who might want to target you or your information. A person or entity that poses a threat to your assets is an “<a href="../glossary/adversary.html" class="glossify-link" title="Your adversary is the person or organization attempting to undermine your security goals. Adversaries can be different, depending on the situation. For instance, you may worry about criminals spying on the network at a cafe, or your classmates at a school. Often the adversary is hypothetical. ">adversary<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a>.” Examples of potential adversaries are your boss, your former partner, your business competition, your government, or a hacker on a public network.</p>
<p><em>Make a list of your adversaries, or those who might want to get ahold of your assets. Your list may include individuals, a government agency, or corporations.</em></p>
<p class="warning">Depending on who your adversaries are, under some circumstances this list might be something you want to destroy after you’re done threat modeling.</p>
<h3>How bad are the consequences if I fail?</h3>
<p>There are many ways that an adversary can threaten your data. For example, an adversary can read your private communications as they pass through the network, or they can delete or corrupt your data.</p>
<p>The motives of adversaries differ widely, as do their attacks. A government trying to prevent the spread of a video showing police violence may be content to simply delete or reduce the availability of that video. In contrast, a political opponent may wish to gain access to secret content and publish that content without you knowing.</p>
<p>Threat modeling involves understanding how bad the consequences could be if an adversary successfully attacks one of your assets. To determine this, you should consider the <a href="../glossary/capability.html" class="glossify-link" title="The capability of an attacker (in the sense we use it in this guide) is what it is able to do to achieve its aims. For example, a country's security services might have the capability to listen to telephone calls while a neighbor may have the capability to watch you from their window. To say that an attacker “has&quot; a capability does not mean that they will necessarily use that capability. It does mean that you should consider and prepare for the possibility. ">capability<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a> of your adversary. For example, your mobile phone provider has access to all your phone records and thus has the capability to use that data against you. A hacker on an open Wi-Fi network can access your unencrypted communications. Your government might have stronger capabilities.</p>
<p><em>Write down what your adversary might want to do with your private data.</em></p>
<h3>How likely is it that I will need to protect it?</h3>
<p>Risk is the likelihood that a particular threat against a particular asset will actually occur. It goes hand-in-hand with capability. While your mobile phone provider has the capability to access all of your data, the risk of them posting your private data online to harm your reputation is low.</p>
<p>It is important to distinguish between threats and risks. While a threat is a bad thing that can happen, risk is the likelihood that the threat will occur. For instance, there is a threat that your building might collapse, but the risk of this happening is far greater in San Francisco (where earthquakes are common) than in Stockholm (where they are not).</p>
<p>Conducting a <a href="../glossary/risk-analysis.html" class="glossify-link" title="In computer security, risk analysis is calculating the chance that threats might succeed, so you know how much effort to spend defending against them. There may be many different ways that you might lose control or access to your data, but some of them are less likely than others. Assessing risk means deciding which threats you are going to take seriously, and which may be too rare or too harmless (or too difficult to combat) to worry about. See threat modeling. ">risk analysis<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a> is both a personal and a subjective process; not everyone has the same priorities or views threats in the same way. Many people find certain threats unacceptable no matter what the risk, because the mere presence of the threat at any likelihood is not worth the cost. In other cases, people disregard high risks because they don't view the threat as a problem.</p>
<p><em>Write down which threats you are going to take seriously, and which may be too rare or too harmless (or too difficult to combat) to worry about.</em></p>
<h3>How much trouble am I willing to go through to try to prevent potential consequences?</h3>
<p>Answering this question requires conducting the risk analysis. Not everyone has the same priorities or views threats in the same way.</p>
<p>For example, an attorney representing a client in a national security case would probably be willing to go to greater lengths to protect communications about that case, such as using encrypted email, than a mother who regularly emails her daughter funny cat videos.</p>
<p><em>Write down what options you have available to you to help mitigate your unique threats. Note if you have any financial constraints, technical constraints, or social constraints.</em></p>

<p>Some webmail providers that use HTTPS by default include:</p>

</ul><p>Some webmail providers that give you the option of choosing to use HTTPS by default by selecting it in your settings. The most popular service that still does this is Hotmail.</p>
<p>What does transport-layer encryption do and why might you need it? HTTPS, also referred to as SSL or TLS, encrypts your communications so that it cannot be read by other people on your network. This can include the other people using the same Wi-Fi in an airport or at a café, the other people at your office or school, the administrators at your ISP, malicious hackers, governments, or law enforcement officials. Communications sent over your web browser, including the web pages that you visit and the content of your emails, blog posts, and messages, using HTTP rather than HTTPS are trivial for an attacker to intercept and read.</p>
<p>HTTPS is the most basic level of encryption for your web browsing that we recommend for everybody. It is as basic as putting on your seat belt when you drive.</p>
<p>But there are some things that HTTPS does not do. When you send email using HTTPS, your email provider still gets an unencrypted copy of your communication. Governments and law enforcement may be able to access this data with a warrant. In the United States, most email providers have a policy that says they will tell you when you have received a government request for your user data as long as they are legally allowed to do so, but these policies are strictly voluntary, and in many cases providers are legally prevented from informing their users of requests for data. Some email providers, such as Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft, publish transparency reports, detailing the number of government requests for user data they receive, which countries make the requests, and how often the company has complied by turning over data.</p>

(They will need to break your <a href="../glossary/password-manager.html" class="glossify-link" title="A tool that can encrypt and store your passwords using a single master password making it practical to use many different passwords on different sites and services without having to memorize them.

We use &quot;passphrase&quot; to convey the idea that a password which is a single word is far too short to protect you and a longer phrase is much better. The webcomic XKCD has a good explanation. http://xkcd.com/936/ ">passphrase<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a> though.)</p>
<p>If this is concerning, don't sync your passwords to the cloud and instead opt to store them on just your devices.</p>
<p class="tip">Keep a backup of your password database just in case. Having a backup is useful if you lose your password database in a crash, or if your device is taken away from you. Password managers usually have a way to make a backup file, or you can use your regular backup program.</p>

<p>Strong, unique passwords make it much harder for bad actors to access your accounts. To further protect your accounts, enable <a href="../glossary/two-factor-authentication.html" class="glossify-link" title="&quot;Something you know, and something you have.&quot; Login systems that require only a username and password risk being broken when someone else can obtain (or guess) those pieces of information. Services that offer two-factor authentication also require you to provide a separate confirmation that you are who you say you are. The second factor could be a one-off secret code, a number generated by a program running on a mobile device, or a device that you carry and that you can use to confirm who you are. Companies like banks, and major internet services like Google, Paypal and Twitter now offer two-factor authentication. ">two-factor authentication<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a>.</p>
<p>Some services offer two-factor authentication (also called 2FA, multi-factor authentication, or two-step verification), which requires users to possess two components (a <a href="../glossary/password.html" class="glossify-link" title="A secret meant to be memorized, and meant to limit access to something so that only someone who knows the password can gain access. It might limit access to an online account, a device, or something else. A long password based on multiple words may also be called a &quot;passphrase&quot; to remind us that it's not just one &quot;word.&quot; A main password to unlock other passwords in a password manager or password safe application is often called a &quot;master password.” ">password<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/modules/patched/glossify/info.png" /></a> and a second factor) to gain access to their account. The second factor could be a one-off secret code or a number generated by a program running on a mobile device.</p>
<p>Two-factor authentication using a mobile phone can be done in one of two ways:</p>
<ul><li>your phone can run an authenticator application that generates security codes (such as <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en" rel="noreferrer">Google Authenticator</a> or <a href="https://authy.com/" rel="noreferrer">Authy</a>) or you can use a stand-alone hardware device (such as a YubiKey); or</li>
<li>the service can send you an SMS text message with an extra security code that you need to type in whenever you log in.</li>
</ul><p class="tip">If you have a choice, pick the authenticator application or stand-alone hardware device instead of receiving codes by text message. It’s easier for an attacker to redirect these codes to their own phone than it is to bypass the authenticator.</p>
<p>Some services, such as Google, also allow you to generate a list of one-time passwords, also called single-use passwords. These are meant to be printed or written down on paper and carried with you. Each of these passwords works only once, so if one is stolen by spyware when you enter it, the thief won't be able to use it for anything in the future.</p>
<p class="tip">If you or your organization run your own communications infrastructure, there's free software available that can be used to enable two-factor authentication for accessing your systems. Look for software offering implementations of the open standard “Time-Based One-Time Passwords” or <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238" rel="noreferrer">RFC 6238</a>.</p>

When one does this, the computer just makes the file invisible to the user and marks the part of the disk that the file was stored on as "available”—meaning that your <a href="../glossary/operating-system.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="operating system" title="A program that runs all the other programs on a computer.

Windows, Android and Apple's OS X and iOS are all examples of operating systems. ">operating system<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/themes/ssd/img/info.png" /></a> can now write over the file with new data. Therefore, it may be weeks, months, or even years before that file is overwritten with a new one. Until this happens, that “deleted” file is still on your disk; it’s just invisible to normal operations. And with a little work and the right tools (such as “undelete” software or forensic methods), you can even still retrieve the “deleted” file. The bottom line is that computers normally don't "delete" files; they just allow the space those files take up to be overwritten by something else some time in the future.</p>
<p>The best way to delete a file forever, then, is to make sure it gets overwritten immediately, in a way that makes it difficult to retrieve what used to be written there. Your operating system probably already has software that can do this for you—software that can overwrite all of the "empty" space on your disk with gibberish and thereby protect the confidentiality of deleted data.</p>
<p>Note that securely deleting data from solid state drives (SSDs), USB flash drives, and SD cards is very hard! The instructions below apply <em>only</em> to traditional disk drives, and <em>not</em> to SSDs, which are becoming standard in modern laptops, USB keys/USB thumb drives, or SD cards/flash memory cards.</p>
<p>This is because these types or drives use a technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wear_leveling" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">wear leveling</a>. (You can read more about why this causes problems for secure deletion <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2011/03/ask-ars-how-can-i-safely-erase-the-data-from-my-ssd-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.)</p>
<p>If you’re using an SSD or a USB flash drive, you can <a href="#Anchor 1">jump to the section below</a>.</p>
<p>On Linux, we currently suggest using BleachBit. BleachBit is an open-source secure deletion tool for Windows and Linux, and is much more sophisticated than the built-in “shred.”</p>
<p>BleachBit can be used to quickly and easily target individual files for secure deletion, or to implement periodic secure deletion policies. It is also possible to write custom file deletion instructions.

<h3>Using Presets</h3>
<p class="TextBody">Some software leaves behind records of when and how it was used. Two important examples that merely begin to illustrate this widespread issue are Recent Documents and <a href="../glossary/web-browser.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="web browser" title="The program you use to view web sites on the Internet. Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer and Chrome are all web browsers. Smartphones have a built-in web browser app for the same purpose.

Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer and Chrome are all web browsers. Smartphones have a built-in web browser app for the same purpose. ">web browser<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/themes/ssd/img/info.png" /></a> history. Software that tracks the recently-edited documents leaves a record of the names of files you've been working with, even if those files themselves have been deleted. And web browsers usually keep detailed records of what sites you've visited recently, and even keep cached copies of pages and images from those sites to make them load faster next time you visit.</p>
<p class="TextBody">Bleachbit provides "presets" that can remove some of these records for you, based on the Bleachbit authors' research about locations of records on your computer that tend to reveal your previous activity. We'll describe using just two of these presets so you can get an idea of how they work.</p>

</div><div class="field-item odd"><a name="5"></a> <h2><a id="warning" name="warning"></a>A Warning About the Limitations of Secure Deletion Tools <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#5">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>First, remember that the advice above only deletes files on the disk of the computer you’re using. None of the tools above will delete backups that were made to somewhere else on your computer, another disk or USB drive, a “Time Machine,” on an email server, or in the cloud. In order to securely delete a file, you must delete <em>every</em> <em>copy</em> of that file, <em>everywhere it was stored or sent.</em> Additionally, once a file is stored in the cloud (e.g. via Dropbox or some other file-sharing service) then there’s usually no way to guarantee that it will be deleted forever.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there’s also another limitation to secure deletion tools. Even if you follow the advice above and you’ve deleted all copies of a file, there is a chance that certain traces of deleted files may persist on your computer, not because the files themselves haven't been properly deleted, but because some part of the <a href="../glossary/operating-system.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="operating system" title="A program that runs all the other programs on a computer. Windows, Android and Apple's OS X and iOS are all examples of operating systems. " data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" data-html="true" data-toggle="popover" data-container="body" data-content="A program that runs all the other programs on a computer. Windows, Android and Apple's OS X and iOS are all examples of operating systems. ">operating system<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/themes/ssd/img/info.png" /></a> or some other program keeps a deliberate record of them.</p>
<p>There are many ways in which this could occur, but two examples should suffice to convey the possibility. On Windows or Mac OS, a copy of Microsoft Office may retain a reference to the name of a file in the "Recent Documents" menu, even if the file has been deleted (Office might sometimes even keep temporary files containing the contents of the file). On a Linux or other *nix system, OpenOffice may keep as many records as Microsoft Office, and a user's shell history file may contain commands that include the file's name, even though the file has been securely deleted. In practice, there may be dozens of programs that behave like this.</p>
<p>It's hard to know how to respond to this problem. It is safe to assume that even if a file has been securely deleted, its name will probably continue to exist for some time on your computer. Overwriting the entire disk is the only way to be 100% sure the name is gone. Some of you may be wondering, "Could I search the raw data on the disk to see if there are any copies of the data anywhere?" The answer is yes and no. Searching the disk (e.g. by using a command like <code>grep -ab /dev/</code> on Linux) will tell you if the data is present in plaintext, but it won't tell you if some program has compressed or otherwise coded references to it. Also be careful that the search itself does not leave a record! The probability that the file's contents may persist is lower, but not impossible. Overwriting the entire disk and installing a fresh operating system is the only way to be 100% certain that records of a file have been erased.</p>
</div><div class="field-item even"><a name="6"></a> <h2><a id="secure_deletion" name="secure_deletion"></a>Secure Deletion When Discarding Old Hardware <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#6">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>If you want to finally throw a piece of hardware away or sell it on eBay, you'll want to make sure no one can retrieve your data from it.

">wear leveling<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/themes/ssd/img/info.png" /></a> works as follows. The space on every disk is divided into blocks, kind of like the pages in a book. When a file is written to disk, it’s assigned to a certain block or set of blocks (pages). If you wanted to overwrite the file then all you would have to do is tell the disk to overwrite those blocks. But in SSDs and USB drives, erasing and re-writing the same block can wear it out. Each block can only be erased and rewritten a limited number of times before that block just won’t work anymore (the same way if you keep writing and erasing with a pencil and paper, eventually the paper might rip and be useless). To counteract this, SSDs and USB drives will try to make sure that the amount of times each block has been erased and rewritten is about the same, so that the drive will last as long as possible (thus the term wear leveling). As a side effect, sometimes instead of erasing and writing the block a file was originally stored on, the drive will instead leave that block alone, mark it as invalid, and just write the modified file to a different block. This is kind of like leaving the page in the book unchanged, writing the modified file on a different page, and then just updating the book’s table of contents to point to the new page.

When one does this, the computer just makes the file invisible to the user and marks the part of the disk that the file was stored on as "available”—meaning that your <a href="../glossary/operating-system.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="operating system" title="A program that runs all the other programs on a computer.

">operating system<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/themes/ssd/img/info.png" /></a> can now write over the file with new data. Therefore, it may be weeks, months, or even years before that file is overwritten with a new one. Until this happens, that “deleted” file is still on your disk; it’s just invisible to normal operations. And with a little work and the right tools (such as “undelete” software or forensic methods), you can even still retrieve the “deleted” file. The bottom line is that computers normally don't "delete" files; they just allow the space those files take up to be overwritten by something else some time in the future.</p>
<p>The best way to delete a file forever, then, is to make sure it gets overwritten immediately, in a way that makes it difficult to retrieve what used to be written there. Your operating system probably already has software that can do this for you—software that can overwrite all of the "empty" space on your disk with gibberish and thereby protect the confidentiality of deleted data.</p>
<p>Note that securely deleting data from solid state drives (SSDs), USB flash drives, and SD cards is very hard! The instructions below apply <em>only</em> to traditional disk drives, and <em>not</em> to SSDs, which are becoming standard in modern laptops, USB keys/USB thumb drives, or SD cards/flash memory cards.</p>
<p>This is because these types or drives use a technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wear_leveling" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">wear leveling</a>. (You can read more about why this causes problems for secure deletion <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2011/03/ask-ars-how-can-i-safely-erase-the-data-from-my-ssd-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.)</p>
<p>If you’re using an SSD or a USB flash drive, you can <a href="#Anchor 1">jump to the section below</a>.</p>
</div><div class="field-item odd"><a name="1"></a> <h2>Secure Deletion on Mac OS X <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#1">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>On OS X 10.4 to 10.10, you can securely delete files by moving them to the Trash and then selecting Finder &gt; Secure Empty Trash.</p>
<p>The Secure Empty Trash feature was removed in OS X 10.11, because Apple felt that it could not guarantee secure deletion on the fast flash (SSD) drives that most of its modern models now use.</p>
<p>If you use a traditional hard drive, and are comfortable with the command line, you can still use the Mac's <code>srm</code> command to overwrite the file. <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/3005796/operating-systems/how-to-replace-secure-empty-trash-in-os-x-el-capitan.html" rel="noreferrer">Fuller instructions (in English) are available here</a>.</p>
</div><div class="field-item even"><a name="2"></a> <h2>A Warning About the Limitations of Secure Deletion Tools <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#2">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>First, remember that the advice above only deletes files on the disk of the computer you’re using. None of the tools above will delete backups that were made to somewhere else on your computer, another disk or USB drive, a “Time Machine,” on an email server, or in the cloud. In order to securely delete a file, you must delete <em>every</em> <em>copy</em> of that file, <em>everywhere it was stored or sent.</em> Additionally, once a file is stored in the cloud (e.g. via Dropbox or some other file-sharing service) then there’s usually no way to guarantee that it will be deleted forever.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there’s also another limitation to secure deletion tools. Even if you follow the advice above and you’ve deleted all copies of a file, there is a chance that certain traces of deleted files may persist on your computer, not because the files themselves haven't been properly deleted, but because some part of the <a href="../glossary/operating-system.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="operating system" title="A program that runs all the other programs on a computer. Windows, Android and Apple's OS X and iOS are all examples of operating systems. " data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" data-html="true" data-toggle="popover" data-container="body" data-content="A program that runs all the other programs on a computer. Windows, Android and Apple's OS X and iOS are all examples of operating systems. ">operating system<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/themes/ssd/img/info.png" /></a> or some other program keeps a deliberate record of them.</p>
<p>There are many ways in which this could occur, but two examples should suffice to convey the possibility. On Windows or Mac OS, a copy of Microsoft Office may retain a reference to the name of a file in the "Recent Documents" menu, even if the file has been deleted (Office might sometimes even keep temporary files containing the contents of the file). On a Linux or other *nix system, OpenOffice may keep as many records as Microsoft Office, and a user's shell history file may contain commands that include the file's name, even though the file has been securely deleted. In practice, there may be dozens of programs that behave like this.</p>
<p>It's hard to know how to respond to this problem. It is safe to assume that even if a file has been securely deleted, its name will probably continue to exist for some time on your computer. Overwriting the entire disk is the only way to be 100% sure the name is gone. Some of you may be wondering, "Could I search the raw data on the disk to see if there are any copies of the data anywhere?" The answer is yes and no. Searching the disk (e.g. by using a command like <code>grep -ab /dev/</code> on Linux) will tell you if the data is present in plaintext, but it won't tell you if some program has compressed or otherwise coded references to it. Also be careful that the search itself does not leave a record! The probability that the file's contents may persist is lower, but not impossible. Overwriting the entire disk and installing a fresh operating system is the only way to be 100% certain that records of a file have been erased.</p>

<p>BleachBit has a number of other features. The most useful may be to “wipe free space.” This will attempt to remove any traces of files you have already deleted. Often Windows will leave all or part of the data from deleted files in the remaining free space left on the hard drive.  “Wipe free space” will overwrite these supposedly empty parts of the hard drive with random data. Wiping free space can take a lot of time, depending on how much spare capacity your drive has.</p>
</div><div class="field-item even"><a name="4"></a> <h2>A Warning About the Limitations of Secure Deletion Tools <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#4">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>First, remember that the advice above only deletes files on the disk of the computer you’re using. None of the tools above will delete backups that were made to somewhere else on your computer, another disk or USB drive, a “Time Machine,” on an email server, or in the cloud. In order to securely delete a file, you must delete <em>every</em> <em>copy</em> of that file, <em>everywhere it was stored or sent.</em> Additionally, once a file is stored in the cloud (e.g. via Dropbox or some other file-sharing service) then there’s usually no way to guarantee that it will be deleted forever.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there’s also another limitation to secure deletion tools. Even if you follow the advice above and you’ve deleted all copies of a file, there is a chance that certain traces of deleted files may persist on your computer, not because the files themselves haven't been properly deleted, but because some part of the <a href="../glossary/operating-system.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="operating system" title="A program that runs all the other programs on a computer. Windows, Android and Apple's OS X and iOS are all examples of operating systems. " data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" data-html="true" data-toggle="popover" data-container="body" data-content="A program that runs all the other programs on a computer. Windows, Android and Apple's OS X and iOS are all examples of operating systems. ">operating system<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/themes/ssd/img/info.png" /></a> or some other program keeps a deliberate record of them.</p>
<p>There are many ways in which this could occur, but two examples should suffice to convey the possibility. On Windows or Mac OS, a copy of Microsoft Office may retain a reference to the name of a file in the "Recent Documents" menu, even if the file has been deleted (Office might sometimes even keep temporary files containing the contents of the file). On a Linux or other *nix system, OpenOffice may keep as many records as Microsoft Office, and a user's shell history file may contain commands that include the file's name, even though the file has been securely deleted. In practice, there may be dozens of programs that behave like this.</p>
<p>It's hard to know how to respond to this problem. It is safe to assume that even if a file has been securely deleted, its name will probably continue to exist for some time on your computer. Overwriting the entire disk is the only way to be 100% sure the name is gone.</p>
</div><div class="field-item odd"><a name="5"></a> <h2>Secure Deletion When Discarding Old Hardware <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#5">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>If you want to finally throw a piece of hardware away or sell it on eBay, you'll want to make sure no one can retrieve your data from it. Studies have repeatedly found that computer owners usually fail to do this―hard drives are often resold chock-full of highly sensitive information. So, before selling or recycling a computer, be sure to overwrite its storage media with gibberish first. And even if you're not getting rid of it right away, if you have a computer that has reached the end of its life and is no longer in use, it's also safer to wipe the hard drive before stashing the machine in a corner or a closet. <a href="http://dban.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Darik's Boot and Nuke</a> is a tool designed for this purpose, and there are a variety of tutorials on how to use it across the web (including <a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/data-destruction/ss/dban-tutorial.htm" rel="noreferrer">here</a>).</p>

Since the key is a tiny amount of data and can be destroyed almost instantaneously, this represents a much faster alternative to overwriting with software like Darik's Boot and Nuke, which can be quite time-consuming for larger drives. However, this option is only feasible if the hard drive was always encrypted. If you weren't using full-disk encryption ahead of time, you'll need to overwrite the whole drive before getting rid of it.</p>

<p>When it comes to CD-ROMs, you should do the same thing you do with paper―shred them. There are inexpensive shredders that will chew up CD-ROMs. Never just toss a CD-ROM out in the garbage unless you're absolutely sure there's nothing sensitive on it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately due to the way SSDs, USB flash drives, and SD cards work, it is difficult, if not impossible, to securely delete both individual files and free space. As a result your best bet in terms of protection is to use <a href="../node/36/index.html" target="_blank">encryption</a>—that way, even if the file is still on the disk, it will at least look like gibberish to anyone who gets ahold of it and can’t force you to <a href="../glossary/decrypt.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="decrypt" title="Make a secret message or data intelligible.

<p>As we mentioned above, SSDs and USB flash drives use a technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wear_leveling" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">wear leveling</a>. At a high level, <a href="../glossary/wear-leveling.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="wear leveling" title="Some forms of digital storage, like the flash memory used in solid-state drives (SSD) and USB sticks, can wear out if overwritten many times. Wear leveling is a method that spreads the writing of data evenly across all of the media to prevent one part of it being overwritten too many times. Its benefit is that it can make devices last longer. The danger for security-conscious users is that wear leveling interferes with secure erase programs, which deliberately try to overwrite sensitive files with junk data in order to permanently erase them. Rather than trusting secure erase programs with files stored on SSD or USB flash drives, it can be better to use full-disk encryption. Encryption avoids the difficulty of secure erasing by making any file on the drive difficult to recover without the correct passphrase.

">wear leveling<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/themes/ssd/img/info.png" /></a> works as follows. The space on every disk is divided into blocks, kind of like the pages in a book. When a file is written to disk, it’s assigned to a certain block or set of blocks (pages). If you wanted to overwrite the file then all you would have to do is tell the disk to overwrite those blocks. But in SSDs and USB drives, erasing and re-writing the same block can wear it out. Each block can only be erased and rewritten a limited number of times before that block just won’t work anymore (the same way if you keep writing and erasing with a pencil and paper, eventually the paper might rip and be useless). To counteract this, SSDs and USB drives will try to make sure that the amount of times each block has been erased and rewritten is about the same, so that the drive will last as long as possible (thus the term wear leveling). As a side effect, sometimes instead of erasing and writing the block a file was originally stored on, the drive will instead leave that block alone, mark it as invalid, and just write the modified file to a different block. This is kind of like leaving the page in the book unchanged, writing the modified file on a different page, and then just updating the book’s table of contents to point to the new page. All of this occurs at a very low level in the electronics of the disk, so the <a href="../glossary/operating-system.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="operating system" title="A program that runs all the other programs on a computer.

">operating system<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/themes/ssd/img/info.png" /></a> doesn’t even realize it’s happened. This means, however, that even if you try to overwrite a file, there’s no guarantee the drive will actually overwrite it—and that’s why secure deletion with SSDs is so much harder.</p>

<p>Whatever your device calls it, encryption is only as good as your password. If your attacker has your device, they have all the time in the world to try out new passwords. Forensic software can try millions of passwords a second. That means that a four number pin is unlikely to protect your data for very long at all, and even a long password may merely slow down your attacker. A really strong password under these conditions should be over fifteen characters long.</p>
<p>Most of us are not realistically going to learn and enter such passphrases on our phones or mobile devices. So while encryption can be useful to prevent casual access, you should preserve truly confidential data by keeping it hidden from physical access by attackers, or cordoned away on a much more secure machine.</p>
</div><div class="field-item odd"><a name="1"></a> <h2>Create a Secure Machine <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#1">Anchor link</a></h2>
<p>Maintaining a secure environment can be hard work. At best, you have to change passwords, habits, and perhaps the software you use on your main computer or device. At worst, you have to constantly think about whether you're leaking confidential information or using unsafe practices. Even when you know the problems, some solutions may be out of your hands. Other people might require you to continue unsafe digital security practices even after you have explained the dangers. For instance, work colleagues might want you to continue to open email attachments from them, even though you know your attackers could impersonate them and send you <a href="../glossary/malware.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="malware" title="Malware is short for malicious software: programs that are designed to conduct unwanted actions on your device. Computer viruses are malware. So are programs that steal passwords, secretly record you, or delete your data. " data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" data-html="true" data-toggle="popover" data-container="body" data-content="Malware is short for malicious software: programs that are designed to conduct unwanted actions on your device. Computer viruses are malware. So are programs that steal passwords, secretly record you, or delete your data. ">malware<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/themes/ssd/img/info.png" /></a>. Or you may be concerned that your main computer has already been compromised.</p>
<p>One strategy to consider is cordoning off valuable data and communications onto a more secure computer. Use that machine only occasionally, and when you do, consciously take much more care over your actions. If you need to open attachments, or use insecure software, do it on another machine.</p>
<p class="tip">If you're setting up a secure machine, what extra steps can you take to make it secure?</p>
<p>You can almost certainly keep the device in a more physically safe place: somewhere where you are able to tell if it has been tampered with, such as a locked cabinet.</p>
<p>You can install a privacy- and security-focused <a href="../glossary/operating-system.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="operating system" title="A program that runs all the other programs on a computer. Windows, Android and Apple's OS X and iOS are all examples of operating systems. " data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" data-html="true" data-toggle="popover" data-container="body" data-content="A program that runs all the other programs on a computer. Windows, Android and Apple's OS X and iOS are all examples of operating systems. ">operating system<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/themes/ssd/img/info.png" /></a> like Tails. You might not be able (or want) to use an open source operating system in your everyday work, but if you just need to store, edit and write confidential emails or instant messages from this secure device, Tails will work well, and defaults to high security settings.</p>
<p>An extra, secure computer may not be as expensive an option as you think. A computer that is seldom used, and only runs a few programs, does not need to be particularly fast or new. You can buy an older netbook for a fraction of the price of a modern laptop or phone. Older machines also have the advantage that secure software like Tails may be more likely to work with them than newer models.</p>
<p>You can use the secure machine to keep the primary copy of confidential data. A secure machine can be valuable in cordoning off private data in this way, but you should also consider a couple of extra risks it might create. If you concentrate your most treasured information onto this one computer, it may make it more of an obvious target. Keep it well hidden, don't discuss its location, and don't neglect to <a href="../glossary/encrypt.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="encrypt" title="To apply encryption technology to any sort of information or communication.

<p>Another risk is the danger that destroying this one machine will destroy your only copy of the data.</p>
<p class="warning">If your <a href="../glossary/adversary.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="adversary" title="Your adversary is the person or organization attempting to undermine your security goals.

Encrypt a copy and keep it somewhere else.</p>
<p>The highest level of protection from Internet attacks or online surveillance is, not surprisingly, not connecting to the Internet at all. You could make sure your secure computer never connects to a local network or Wifi, and only copy files onto the machine using physical media, like DVDs or USB drives. In network security, this is known as having an "<a href="../glossary/air-gap.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="air gap" title="A computer or network that is physically isolated from all other networks, including the Internet, is said to be air-gapped.

">air gap<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/themes/ssd/img/info.png" /></a>" between the computer and the rest of the world. Not many people go this far, but it can be an option if you want to keep data that is rarely accessed but you never want to lose. Examples might be an <a href="../glossary/encryption-key.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="encryption key" title="An encryption key is a piece of information that is used to convert a message into an unreadable form.

In most of these cases, you might want to consider just having a hidden storage device, rather than a full computer. An encrypted USB <a href="../glossary/key.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="key" title="In cryptography, a piece of data which gives you the capability to encrypt or decrypt a message.

">key<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/themes/ssd/img/info.png" /></a> kept safely hidden is probably as useful (or as useless) as a complete computer unplugged from the Internet.</p>
<p>If you do use the secure device to connect to the Internet, you might choose not to log in or use your usual accounts. Create separate web or email accounts that you use for communications from this device, and use Tor to keep your <a href="../glossary/ip-address.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="IP address" title="A device on the Internet needs its own address to receive data, just like a home or business needs a street address to receive physical mail.

<p class="tip">A variation on the idea of a secure machine is to have an <em>insecure machine: </em>a device that you only use when you are going into dangerous places or need to try a risky operation. Many journalists and activists, for instance, take a minimal netbook with them when they travel. This computer does not have any of their documents, usual contact or email information on it, and so is less of a loss if it is confiscated or scanned. You can apply the same strategy to mobile phones. If you usually use a smartphone, consider buying a cheap throwaway or <a href="../glossary/burner-phone.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="burner phone" title="A phone that is not connected to your identity, is only used for a small set of calls or activities, and can be discarded if and when it is suspected of being tracked or compromised.

Did you know that the government has the right to, without a warrant, search travelers at the border—including when they land at international airports—as part of its traditional power to control the flow of items into the country? (Note that although some of the same legal justifications exist for searches of those leaving the US and that such searches are possible, travelers are not routinely searched on their way out of the country.)</p>

</div><div class="field-item odd"><a name="1"></a> <h2>In the Meantime, Here are Some Things to Keep in Mind When Crossing the US Border: <a class="anchor-link-icon" href="#1">Anchor link</a></h2>
<ul><li>
<p>Have you backed up your devices? This may help in case one or more of your devices is seized. You can use an online backup service or an external hard drive, though we don't recommend carrying both your laptop and your backup hard drive at the same time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you need to be carrying so much data? We suggest minimizing the amount of data you are carrying over the border. Consider traveling with a "clean" laptop, and note that simply dragging files to your trash doesn't delete them completely. Make sure you securely delete your files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are your devices encrypted? We recommend full-disk <a href="../glossary/encryption.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="encryption" title="A process that takes a message and makes it unreadable except to a person who knows how to &quot;decrypt&quot; it back into a readable form.

">encryption<img src="https://ssd.eff.org/sites/all/themes/ssd/img/info.png" /></a> on your devices (laptops, mobile phones, etc.) and choosing secure passphrases. If a border agent asks for your <a href="../glossary/passphrase.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="passphrase" title="A passphrase is a kind of password. We use &quot;passphrase&quot; to convey the idea that a password which is a single word is far too short to protect you and a longer phrase is much better.

Only a judge can force you to reveal such information. However, refusal to comply could bear consequences: for noncitizens, you may be refused entry into the country; for citizens, you may be detained until the border patrol decides what to do, which may include seizing your computer, phone, camera, USB sticks, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you enter a new country, consider purchasing a temporary phone and transferring your <a href="../glossary/sim-card.html" class="glossify-link" data-title="SIM card" title="A small, removable card that can be inserted into a mobile phone in order to provide service with a particular mobile phone company.

This phone will carry far less data than your normal phone.</p>

<p>When dealing with border guards, remember these three things:<em> Be courteous, do not lie</em>, and <em>do not</em> physically interfere with the agent’s search.</p>
